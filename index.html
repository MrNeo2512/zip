He tried &nbsp;to take a proper breath, choked, coughed up water, spat out mud. He groaned, &nbsp;flopped over onto his hands and knees, dragged himself up out of the river, &nbsp;gasping through clenched teeth, rolled onto his back in the moss and slime and &nbsp;rotten sticks at the water&rsquo;s edge. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c0">He lay there for a moment, staring up at the grey sky beyond the black &nbsp;branches, breath wheezing in his raw throat. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c119"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I am still alive,&rsquo; he croaked to himself. Still alive, in spite of the best efforts of &nbsp;nature, Shanka, men and beasts. Soaking wet and flat on his back, he started to &nbsp;chuckle. Reedy, gurgling laughter. Say one thing for Logen Ninefingers, say he&rsquo;s a &nbsp;survivor. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c342"><span class="c0">A cold wind blew across the rotting river bank, and Logen&rsquo;s laughter slowly &nbsp;died. Alive he might be, but staying alive, that was another question. He sat up, &nbsp;wincing at the pain. He tottered to his feet, leaning against the nearest tree trunk. &nbsp;He scraped the dirt out of his nose, his eyes, his ears. He pulled up his wet shirt to &nbsp;take a look at the damage. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c258"><span class="c0">His side was covered in bruises from the fall. Blue and purple stains all up his &nbsp;ribs. Tender to the touch, and no mistake, but it didn&rsquo;t feel like anything was &nbsp;broken. His leg was a mess. Torn and bloody from the Shanka&rsquo;s teeth. It hurt bad, &nbsp;but his foot still moved well enough, and that was the main thing. He&rsquo;d need his &nbsp;foot, if he was going to get out of this. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c172"><span class="c0">He still had his knife in the sheath at his belt, and he was mightily glad to see &nbsp;it. You could never have too many knives in Logen&rsquo;s experience, and this was a &nbsp;good one, but the outlook was still bleak. He was on his own, in woods crawling &nbsp;with Flatheads. He had no idea where he was, but he could follow the river. The &nbsp;rivers all flowed north, from the mountains to the cold sea. Follow the river </span></p><p class="c102"><span class="c0">southwards, against the current. Follow the river and climb up, into the High &nbsp;Places where the Shanka couldn&rsquo;t find him. That was his only chance. &nbsp;It would be cold up there, this time of year. Deadly cold. He looked down at &nbsp;his bare feet. It was just his luck that the Shanka had come while he had his boots &nbsp;off, trimming his blisters. No coat either &ndash; he&rsquo;d been sitting near the fire. Like &nbsp;this, he wouldn&rsquo;t last a day in the mountains. His hands and feet would turn black &nbsp;in the night, and he&rsquo;d die bit by bit before he even reached the passes. If he didn&rsquo;t &nbsp;starve first. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c41"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Shit,&rsquo; he muttered. He had to go back to the camp. He had to hope the &nbsp;Flatheads had moved on, hope they&rsquo;d left something behind. Something he could &nbsp;use to survive. That was an awful lot of hoping, but he had no choice. He never &nbsp;had any choices. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c219"><span class="c0">It had started to rain by the time Logen found the place. Spitting drops that &nbsp;plastered his hair to his skull, kept his clothes wet through. He pressed himself &nbsp;against a mossy trunk and peered out towards the camp, heart pounding, fingers &nbsp;of his right hand curled painful tight around the slippery grip of his knife. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c289"><span class="c0">He saw the blackened circle where the fire had been, half-burned sticks and &nbsp;ash trampled round it. He saw the big log Threetrees and Dow had been sitting &nbsp;on when the Flatheads came. He saw odd bits of torn and broken gear scattered &nbsp;across the clearing. He counted three dead Shanka crumpled on the ground, one &nbsp;with an arrow poking out of its chest. Three dead ones, but no sign of any alive. &nbsp;That was lucky. Just lucky enough to survive, as always. Still, they might be back &nbsp;at any moment. He had to be quick. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c190"><span class="c0">Logen scuttled out from the trees, casting about on the ground. His boots &nbsp;were still there where he&rsquo;d left them. He snatched them up and dragged them on &nbsp;to his freezing feet, hopping around, almost slipping in his haste. His coat was &nbsp;there too, wedged under the log, battered and scarred from ten years of weather &nbsp;and war, torn and stitched back together, missing half a sleeve. His pack was &nbsp;lying shapeless in the brush nearby, its contents strewn out down the slope. He &nbsp;crouched, breathless, throwing it all back inside. A length of rope, his old clay &nbsp;pipe, some strips of dried meat, needle and twine, a dented flask with some &nbsp;liquor still sloshing inside. All good. All useful.</span></p><p class="c314"><span class="c0">There was a tattered blanket snagged on a branch, wet and half caked in &nbsp;grime. Logen pulled it up, and grinned. His old, battered cook pot was &nbsp;underneath. Lying on its side, kicked off the fire in the fight maybe. He grabbed &nbsp;hold of it with both hands. It felt safe, familiar, dented and blackened from years &nbsp;of hard use. He&rsquo;d had that pot a long time. It had followed him all through the &nbsp;wars, across the North and back again. They had all cooked in it together, out on &nbsp;the trail, all eaten out of it. Forley, Grim, the Dogman, all of them. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c189"><span class="c0">Logen looked over the campsite again. Three dead Shanka, but none of his &nbsp;people. Maybe they were still out there. Maybe if he took a risk, tried to look&mdash; &nbsp;&lsquo;No.&rsquo; He said it quietly, under his breath. He knew better than that. There had &nbsp;been a lot of Flatheads. An awful lot. He had no idea how long he&rsquo;d lain on the &nbsp;river bank. Even if a couple of the boys had got away, the Shanka would be &nbsp;hunting them, hunting them down in the forests. They were nothing but corpses &nbsp;now, for sure, scattered across the high valleys. All Logen could do was make for &nbsp;the mountains, and try to save his own sorry life. You have to be realistic. Have to &nbsp;be, however much it hurts. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c200"><span class="c0">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s just you and me now,&rsquo; said Logen as he stuffed the pot into his pack and &nbsp;threw it over his shoulder. He started to limp off, as fast as he could. Uphill, &nbsp;towards the river, towards the mountains. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c126"><span class="c0">Just the two of them. Him and the pot. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c63"><span class="c0">They were the only survivors. </span></p><p class="c50"><span class="c1">Questions </span></p><p class="c275"><span class="c0">Why do I do this? Inquisitor Glokta asked himself for the thousandth time as he &nbsp;limped down the corridor. The walls were rendered and whitewashed, though &nbsp;none too recently. There was a seedy feel to the place and a smell of damp. There &nbsp;were no windows, as the hallway was deep beneath the ground, and the lanterns &nbsp;cast slow flowing shadows into every corner. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c62"><span class="c0">Why would anyone want to do this? Glokta&rsquo;s walking made a steady rhythm on &nbsp;the grimy tiles of the floor. First the confident click of his right heel, then the tap &nbsp;of his cane, then the endless sliding of his left foot, with the familiar stabbing &nbsp;pains in the ankle, knee, arse and back. Click, tap, pain. That was the rhythm of &nbsp;his walking. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c155"><span class="c0">The dirty monotony of the corridor was broken from time to time by a heavy &nbsp;door, bound and studded with pitted iron. On one occasion, Glokta thought he &nbsp;heard a muffled cry of pain from behind one. I wonder what poor fool is being &nbsp;questioned in there? What crime they are guilty, or innocent of? What secrets are &nbsp;being picked at, what lies cut through, what treasons laid bare? He didn&rsquo;t wonder &nbsp;long though. He was interrupted by the steps. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c213"><span class="c0">If Glokta had been given the opportunity to torture any one man, any one at &nbsp;all, he would surely have chosen the inventor of steps. When he was young and &nbsp;widely admired, before his misfortunes, he had never really noticed them. He &nbsp;had sprung down them two at a time and gone blithely on his way. No &nbsp;more. They&rsquo;re everywhere. You really can&rsquo;t change floors without them. And down &nbsp;is worse than up, that&rsquo;s the thing people never realise. Going up, you usually don&rsquo;t &nbsp;fall that far. </span></p><p class="c130"><span class="c0">He knew this flight well. Sixteen steps, cut from smooth stone, a little worn &nbsp;toward the centre, slightly damp, like everything down here. There was no &nbsp;banister, nothing to cling to. Sixteen enemies. A challenge indeed. It had taken &nbsp;Glokta a long time to develop the least painful method of descending stairs. He &nbsp;went sideways like a crab. Cane first, then left foot, then right, with more than the &nbsp;usual agony as his left leg took his weight, joined by a persistent stabbing in the </span></p><p class="c261"><span class="c0">neck. Why should it hurt in my neck when I go down stairs? Does my neck take my &nbsp;weight? Does it? Yet the pain could not be denied. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c156"><span class="c0">Glokta paused four steps from the bottom. He had nearly beaten them. His &nbsp;hand was trembling on the handle of his cane, his left leg aching like fury. He &nbsp;tongued his gums where his front teeth used to be, took a deep breath and &nbsp;stepped forward. His ankle gave way with a horrifying wrench and he plunged &nbsp;into space, twisting, lurching, his mind a cauldron of horror and despair. He &nbsp;stumbled onto the next step like a drunkard, fingernails scratching at the smooth &nbsp;wall, giving a squeal of terror. You stupid, stupid bastard! His cane clattered to the &nbsp;floor, his clumsy feet wrestled with the stones and he found himself at the &nbsp;bottom, by some miracle still standing. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c132"><span class="c0">And here it is. That horrible, beautiful, stretched out moment between stubbing &nbsp;your toe and feeling the hurt. How long do I have before the pain comes? How bad &nbsp;will it be when it does? Gasping, slack-jawed at the foot of the steps, Glokta felt a &nbsp;tingling of anticipation. Here it comes . . . </span></p><p class="c167"><span class="c0">The agony was unspeakable, a searing spasm up his left side from foot to jaw. &nbsp;He squeezed his watering eyes tight shut, clamped his right hand over his mouth &nbsp;so hard that the knuckles clicked. His remaining teeth grated against each other &nbsp;as he locked his jaws together, but a high-pitched, jagged moan still whistled &nbsp;from him. Am I screaming or laughing? How do I tell the difference? He breathed &nbsp;in heaving gasps, through his nose, snot bubbling out onto his hand, his twisted &nbsp;body shaking with the effort of staying upright. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c325"><span class="c0">The spasm passed. Glokta moved his limbs cautiously, one by one, testing the &nbsp;damage. His leg was on fire, his foot numb, his neck clicked with every &nbsp;movement, sending vicious little stings down his spine. Pretty good, &nbsp;considering. He bent down with an effort and snatched up his cane between two &nbsp;fingers, drew himself up once more, wiped the snot and tears on the back of his &nbsp;hand. Truly a thrill. Did I enjoy it? For most people stairs are a mundane affair. For &nbsp;me, an adventure! He limped off down the corridor, giggling quietly to himself. He &nbsp;was still smiling ever so faintly when he reached his own door and shuffled &nbsp;inside. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c80"><span class="c0">A grubby white box with two doors facing each other. The ceiling was too low &nbsp;for comfort, the room too brightly lit by blazing lamps. Damp was creeping out of </span></p><p class="c164"><span class="c0">one corner and the plaster had erupted with flaking blisters, speckled with black &nbsp;mould. Someone had tried to scrub a long bloodstain from one wall, but hadn&rsquo;t &nbsp;tried nearly hard enough. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c272"><span class="c0">Practical Frost was standing on the other side of the room, big arms folded &nbsp;across his big chest. He nodded to Glokta, with all the emotion of a stone, and &nbsp;Glokta nodded back. Between them stood a scarred, stained wooden table, bolted &nbsp;to the floor and flanked by two chairs. A naked fat man sat in one of them, hands &nbsp;tied tightly behind him and with a brown canvas bag over his head. His quick, &nbsp;muffled breathing was the only sound. It was cold down here, but he was &nbsp;sweating. As well he should be. </span></p><p class="c53"><span class="c0">Glokta limped over to the other chair, leaned his cane carefully against the &nbsp;edge of the table top and slowly, cautiously, painfully sat down. He stretched his &nbsp;neck to the left and right, then allowed his body to slump into a position &nbsp;approaching comfort. If Glokta had been given the opportunity to shake the hand &nbsp;of any one man, any one at all, he would surely have chosen the inventor of &nbsp;chairs. He has made my life almost bearable. </span></p><p class="c162"><span class="c0">Frost stepped silently out of the corner and took hold of the loose top of the &nbsp;bag between meaty, pale finger and heavy, white thumb. Glokta nodded and the &nbsp;Practical ripped it off, leaving Salem Rews blinking in the harsh light. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c218"><span class="c0">A mean, piggy, ugly little face. You mean, ugly pig, Rews. You disgusting swine. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re ready to confess right now, I&rsquo;ll bet, ready to talk and talk without &nbsp;interruption, until we&rsquo;re all sick of it. There was a big dark bruise across his cheek &nbsp;and another on his jaw above his double chin. As his watering eyes adjusted to &nbsp;the brightness he recognised Glokta sitting opposite him, and his face suddenly &nbsp;filled with hope. A sadly, sadly misplaced hope. </span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Glokta, you have to help me!&rsquo; he squealed, leaning forward as far as his bonds &nbsp;would allow, words bubbling out in a desperate, mumbling mess. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m falsely &nbsp;accused, you know it, I&rsquo;m innocent! You&rsquo;ve come to help me, yes? You&rsquo;re my &nbsp;friend! You have influence here. We&rsquo;re friends, friends! You could say something &nbsp;for me! I&rsquo;m an innocent man, falsely accused! I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c87"><span class="c0">Glokta held up his hand for silence. He stared at Rews&rsquo; familiar face for a &nbsp;moment, as though he had never laid eyes on him before. Then he turned to &nbsp;Frost. &lsquo;Am I supposed to know this man?&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c304"><span class="c0">The albino said nothing. The bottom part of his face was hidden by his &nbsp;Practical&rsquo;s mask, and the top half gave nothing away. He stared unblinking at the &nbsp;prisoner in the chair, pink eyes as dead as a corpse. He hadn&rsquo;t blinked once since &nbsp;Glokta came into the room. How can he do that? </span></p><p class="c173"><span class="c0">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s me, Rews!&rsquo; hissed the fat man, the pitch of his voice rising steadily &nbsp;towards panic. &lsquo;Salem Rews, you know me, Glokta! I was with you in the war, &nbsp;before . . . you know . . . we&rsquo;re friends! We&mdash;&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c221"><span class="c0">Glokta held up his hand again and sat back, tapping one of his few remaining &nbsp;teeth with a fingernail as though deep in thought. &lsquo;Rews. The name is familiar. A &nbsp;merchant, a member of the Guild of Mercers. A rich man by all accounts. I &nbsp;remember now . . .&rsquo; Glokta leaned forward, pausing for effect. &lsquo;He was a traitor! &nbsp;He was taken by the Inquisition, his property confiscated. You see, he had &nbsp;conspired to avoid the King&rsquo;s taxes.&rsquo; Rews&rsquo; mouth was hanging open. &lsquo;The King&rsquo;s &nbsp;taxes!&rsquo; screamed Glokta, smashing his hand down on the table. The fat man &nbsp;stared, wide eyed, and licked at a tooth. Upper right side, second from the back. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">&lsquo;But where are our manners?&rsquo; asked Glokta of no one in particular. &lsquo;We may &nbsp;or may not have known each other once, but I don&rsquo;t think you and my assistant &nbsp;have been properly introduced. Practical Frost, say hello to this fat man.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c117"><span class="c0">It was an open-handed blow, but powerful enough to knock Rews clean out of &nbsp;his seat. The chair rattled but was otherwise unaffected. How is that done? To &nbsp;knock him to the ground but leave the chair standing? Rews sprawled gurgling &nbsp;across the floor, face flattened on the tiles. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c223"><span class="c0">&lsquo;He reminds me of a beached whale,&rsquo; said Glokta absently. The albino grabbed &nbsp;Rews under the arm and hauled him up, flung him back into the chair. Blood &nbsp;seeped from a cut on his cheek, but his piggy eyes were hard now. Blows make &nbsp;most men soften up, but some men harden. I never would have taken this one for a &nbsp;tough man, but life is full of surprises. </span></p><p class="c144"><span class="c0">Rews spat blood onto the table top. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve gone too far here, Glokta, oh yes! &nbsp;The Mercers are an honourable guild; we have influence! They won&rsquo;t put up with &nbsp;this! I&rsquo;m a known man! Even now my wife will be petitioning the King to hear my &nbsp;case!&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c77"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Ah, your wife.&rsquo; Glokta smiled sadly. &lsquo;Your wife is a very beautiful woman. &nbsp;Beautiful, and young. I fear, perhaps, a little too young for you. I fear she took the </span></p><p class="c262"><span class="c0">opportunity to be rid of you. I fear she came forward with your books. All the &nbsp;books.&rsquo; Rews&rsquo; face paled. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c257"><span class="c0">&lsquo;We looked at those books,&rsquo; Glokta indicated an imaginary pile of papers on &nbsp;his left, &lsquo;we looked at the books in the treasury,&rsquo; indicating another on his right. &nbsp;&lsquo;Imagine our surprise when we could not make the numbers add up. And then &nbsp;there were the night-time visits by your employees to warehouses in the old &nbsp;quarter, the small unregistered boats, the payments to officials, the forged &nbsp;documentation. Must I go on?&rsquo; asked Glokta, shaking his head in profound &nbsp;disapproval. The fat man swallowed and licked his lips. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c0">Pen and ink were placed before the prisoner, and the paper of confession, &nbsp;filled out in detail in Frost&rsquo;s beautiful, careful script, awaiting only the &nbsp;signature. I&rsquo;ll get him right here and now. </span></p><p class="c273"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Confess, Rews,&rsquo; Glokta whispered softly, &lsquo;and put a painless end to this &nbsp;regrettable business. Confess and name your accomplices. We already know who &nbsp;they are. It will be easier on all of us. I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you, believe me, it will &nbsp;give me no pleasure.&rsquo; Nothing will. &lsquo;Confess. Confess, and you will be spared. Exile &nbsp;in Angland is not so bad as they would have you believe. There is still pleasure to &nbsp;be had from life there, and the satisfaction of a day of honest work, in the service &nbsp;of your King. Confess!&rsquo; Rews stared at the floor, licking at his tooth. Glokta sat &nbsp;back and sighed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Or not,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I can come back with my instruments.&rsquo; Frost moved &nbsp;forward, his massive shadow falling across the fat man&rsquo;s face. &lsquo;Body found &nbsp;floating by the docks,&rsquo; Glokta breathed, &lsquo;bloated by seawater and horribly &nbsp;mutilated . . . far . . . far beyond recognition.&rsquo; He&rsquo;s ready to talk. He&rsquo;s fat and ripe &nbsp;and ready to burst. &lsquo;Were the injuries inflicted before or after death?&rsquo; he asked &nbsp;the ceiling breezily. &lsquo;Was the mysterious deceased a man or a woman even?&rsquo; &nbsp;Glokta shrugged. &lsquo;Who can say?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c217"><span class="c0">There was a sharp knock at the door. Rews&rsquo; face jerked up, filled with hope &nbsp;again. Not now, damn it! Frost went to the door, opened it a crack. Something was &nbsp;said. The door shut, Frost leaned down to whisper in Glokta&rsquo;s ear. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c227"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Ith Theverar,&rsquo; came the half-tongued mumble, by which Glokta understood &nbsp;that Severard was at the door. </span></p><p class="c236"><span class="c0">Already? Glokta smiled and nodded, as if it was good news. Rews&rsquo; face fell a &nbsp;little. How could a man whose business has been concealment find it impossible to &nbsp;hide his emotions in this room? But Glokta knew how. It&rsquo;s hard to stay calm when &nbsp;you&rsquo;re terrified, helpless, alone, at the mercy of men with no mercy at all. Who &nbsp;could know that better than me? He sighed, and using his most world-weary tone &nbsp;of voice asked, &lsquo;Do you wish to confess?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c93"><span class="c0">&lsquo;No!&rsquo; The defiance had returned to the prisoner&rsquo;s piggy eyes now. He stared &nbsp;back, silent and watchful, and sucked. Surprising. Very surprising. But then we&rsquo;re &nbsp;just getting started. </span></p><p class="c288"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Is that tooth bothering you, Rews?&rsquo; There was nothing Glokta didn&rsquo;t know &nbsp;about teeth. His own mouth had been worked on by the very best. Or the very &nbsp;worst, depending on how you look at it. &lsquo;It seems that I must leave you now, but &nbsp;while I&rsquo;m away, I&rsquo;ll be thinking about that tooth. I&rsquo;ll be considering very carefully &nbsp;what to do with it.&rsquo; He took hold of his cane. &lsquo;I want you to think about me, &nbsp;thinking about your tooth. And I also want you to think, very carefully, about &nbsp;signing your confession.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c122"><span class="c0">Glokta got awkwardly to his feet, shaking out his aching leg. &lsquo;I think you may &nbsp;respond well to a straightforward beating however, so I&rsquo;m going to leave you in &nbsp;the company of Practical Frost for half an hour.&rsquo; Rews&rsquo; mouth became a silent &nbsp;circle of surprise. The albino picked up the chair, fat man and all, and turned it &nbsp;slowly around. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s absolutely the best there is at this kind of thing.&rsquo; Frost took &nbsp;out a pair of battered leather gloves and began to pull them carefully onto his big &nbsp;white hands, one finger at a time. &lsquo;You always did like to have the very best of &nbsp;everything, eh, Rews?&rsquo; Glokta made for the door. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Wait! Glokta!&rsquo; wailed Rews over his shoulder. &lsquo;Wait I&mdash;&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c328"><span class="c0">Practical Frost clamped a gloved hand over the fat man&rsquo;s mouth and held a &nbsp;finger to his mask. &lsquo;Thhhhhhh,&rsquo; he said. The door clicked shut. &nbsp;Severard was leaning against the wall in the corridor, one foot propped on &nbsp;the plaster behind him, whistling tunelessly beneath his mask and running a &nbsp;hand through his long, lanky hair. As Glokta came through the door he &nbsp;straightened up and gave a little bow, and it was plain by his eyes that he was &nbsp;smiling. He&rsquo;s always smiling.</span></p><p class="c54"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Superior Kalyne wants to see you,&rsquo; he said in his broad, common accent, &lsquo;and &nbsp;I&rsquo;m of the opinion that I never saw him angrier.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c267"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Severard, you poor thing, you must be terrified. Do you have the box?&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;I do.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">&lsquo;And you took something out for Frost?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I did.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&lsquo;And something for your wife too, I hope?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c283"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; said Severard, his eyes smiling more than ever, &lsquo;My wife will be well &nbsp;taken care of. If I ever get one.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c140"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Good. I hasten to answer the call of the Superior. When I have been with him &nbsp;for five minutes, come in with the box.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Just barge into his office?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Barge in and stab him in the face for all I care.&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I&rsquo;d consider that done, Inquisitor.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c290"><span class="c0">Glokta nodded, turned away, then turned back. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t really stab him, eh, &nbsp;Severard?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c111"><span class="c0">The Practical smiled with his eyes and sheathed his vicious-looking knife. &nbsp;Glokta rolled his eyes up to the ceiling, then limped off, his cane tapping on the &nbsp;tiles, his leg throbbing. Click, tap, pain. That was the rhythm of his walking. &nbsp;The Superior&rsquo;s office was a large and richly appointed room high up in the House &nbsp;of Questions, a room in which everything was too big and too fancy. A huge, &nbsp;intricate window dominated one wood-panelled wall, offering a view over the &nbsp;well-tended gardens in the courtyard below. An equally huge and ornate desk &nbsp;stood in the centre of a richly coloured carpet from somewhere warm and exotic. &nbsp;The head of a fierce animal from somewhere cold and exotic was mounted above &nbsp;a magnificent stone fireplace with a tiny, mean fire close to burning out inside. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c201"><span class="c0">Superior Kalyne himself made his office look small and drab. A vast, florid &nbsp;man in his late fifties, he had over-compensated for his thinning hair with &nbsp;magnificent white side whiskers. He was considered a daunting presence even &nbsp;within the Inquisition, but Glokta was past scaring, and they both knew it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c240"><span class="c0">There was a big, fancy chair behind the desk, but the Superior was pacing up &nbsp;and down while he screamed, his arms waving. Glokta was seated on something &nbsp;which, while doubtless expensive, had clearly been designed to make its </span></p><p class="c131"><span class="c0">occupant as uncomfortable as possible. It doesn&rsquo;t bother me much, though. &nbsp;Uncomfortable is as good as I ever get. </span></p><p class="c231"><span class="c0">He amused himself with the thought of Kalyne&rsquo;s head mounted above the &nbsp;fireplace instead of that fierce animal&rsquo;s, while the Superior ranted at him. He&rsquo;s &nbsp;every bit like his fireplace, the big dolt. Looks impressive, but there&rsquo;s not much &nbsp;going on underneath. I wonder how he&rsquo;d respond to an interrogation? I&rsquo;d start with &nbsp;those ridiculous side whiskers. But Glokta&rsquo;s face was a mask of attention and &nbsp;respect. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c153"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Well you&rsquo;ve outdone yourself this time, Glokta, you mad cripple! When the &nbsp;Mercers find out about this they&rsquo;ll have you flayed!&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c108"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve tried flaying, it tickles.&rsquo; Damn it, keep your mouth shut and smile. Where&rsquo;s &nbsp;that whistling fool Severard? I&rsquo;ll have him flayed when I get out of here. &lsquo;Oh yes, that&rsquo;s good, that&rsquo;s very good, Glokta, look at me laugh! And evasion of &nbsp;the King&rsquo;s taxes?&rsquo; The Superior glowered down, whiskers bristling. &lsquo;The King&rsquo;s &nbsp;taxes?&rsquo; he screamed, spraying Glokta with spit. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re all at it! The Mercers, the &nbsp;Spicers, all of them! Every damn fool with a boat!&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c295"><span class="c0">&lsquo;But this was so open, Superior. It was an insult to us. I felt we had to&mdash;&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;You felt?&rsquo; Kalyne was red-faced and vibrating with rage. &lsquo;You were explicitly &nbsp;told to keep away from the Mercers, away from the Spicers, away from all the big &nbsp;guilds!&rsquo; He strode up and down with ever greater speed. You&rsquo;ll wear your carpet &nbsp;out at this rate. The big guilds will have to buy you a new one. </span></p><p class="c210"><span class="c0">&lsquo;You felt, did you? Well he&rsquo;ll have to go back! We&rsquo;ll have to release him and &nbsp;you&rsquo;ll have to feel your way to a grovelling apology! It&rsquo;s a damn disgrace! You&rsquo;ve &nbsp;made me look ridiculous! Where is he now?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I left him in the company of Practical Frost.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c90"><span class="c0">&lsquo;With that mumbling animal?&rsquo; The Superior tore at his hair in desperation. &nbsp;&lsquo;Well that&rsquo;s it then, isn&rsquo;t it? He&rsquo;ll be a ruin now! We can&rsquo;t send him back in that &nbsp;condition! You&rsquo;re finished here, Glokta! Finished! I&rsquo;m going straight to the Arch &nbsp;Lector! Straight to the Arch Lector!&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c49"><span class="c0">The huge door was kicked open and Severard sauntered in carrying a &nbsp;wooden box. And not a moment too soon. The Superior stared, speechless, open mouthed with wrath, as Severard dropped it on the desk with a thump and a &nbsp;jingle. </span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c0">&lsquo;What the hell is the meaning of . . .&rsquo; Severard pulled open the lid, and Kalyne &nbsp;saw the money. All that lovely money. He stopped in mid-rant, mouth stuck &nbsp;forming the next sound. He looked surprised, then he looked puzzled, then he &nbsp;looked cautious. He pursed his lips and slowly sat down. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c177"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Thank you, Practical Severard,&rsquo; said Glokta. &lsquo;You may go.&rsquo; The Superior was &nbsp;stroking thoughtfully at his side whiskers as Severard strolled out, his face &nbsp;returning gradually to its usual shade of pink. &lsquo;Confiscated from Rews. The &nbsp;property of the Crown now, of course. I thought that I should give it to you, as my &nbsp;direct superior, so that you could pass it on to the Treasury.&rsquo; Or buy a bigger desk, &nbsp;you leech. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Glokta leaned forward, hands on his knees. &lsquo;You could say, perhaps, that &nbsp;Rews went too far, that questions had been asked, that an example had to be &nbsp;made. We can&rsquo;t be seen to do nothing, after all. It&rsquo;ll make the big guilds nervous, &nbsp;keep them in line.&rsquo; It&rsquo;ll make them nervous and you can screw more out of &nbsp;them. &lsquo;Or you could always tell them that I&rsquo;m a mad cripple, and blame me for it.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c141"><span class="c0">The Superior was starting to like it now, Glokta could tell. He was trying not &nbsp;to show it, but his whiskers were quivering at the sight of all that money. &lsquo;Alright, &nbsp;Glokta. Alright. Very well.&rsquo; He reached out and carefully shut the lid of the box. &nbsp;&lsquo;But if you ever think of doing something like this again . . . talk to me first, would &nbsp;you? I don&rsquo;t like surprises.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Glokta struggled to his feet, limped towards the door. &lsquo;Oh, and one more &nbsp;thing!&rsquo; He turned stiffly back. Kalyne was staring at him severely from beneath &nbsp;his big, fancy brows. &lsquo;When I go to see the Mercers, I&rsquo;ll need to take Rews&rsquo; &nbsp;confession.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c245"><span class="c0">Glokta smiled broadly, showing the yawning gap in his front teeth. &lsquo;That &nbsp;shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, Superior.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c0">Kalyne had been right. There was no way that Rews could have gone back in this &nbsp;condition. His lips were split and bloody, his sides covered in darkening bruises, &nbsp;his head lolled sideways, face swollen almost past recognition. In short, he looks &nbsp;like a man ready to confess. </span></p><p class="c81"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t imagine you enjoyed the last half hour, Rews, I don&rsquo;t imagine you &nbsp;enjoyed it much at all. Perhaps it was the worst half hour of your life, I really &nbsp;couldn&rsquo;t say. I&rsquo;m thinking about what we have for you here, though, and the sad </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">fact is . . . that&rsquo;s about as good as it gets. That&rsquo;s the high life.&rsquo; Glokta leaned &nbsp;forward, his face just inches from the bloody pulp of Rews&rsquo; nose. &lsquo;Practical &nbsp;Frost&rsquo;s a little girl compared to me,&rsquo; he whispered. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a kitten. Once I get &nbsp;started with you, Rews, you&rsquo;ll be looking back on this with nostalgia. You&rsquo;ll be &nbsp;begging me to give you half an hour with the Practical. Do you understand?&rsquo; &nbsp;Rews was silent, except for the air whistling through his broken nose. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Show him the instruments,&rsquo; whispered Glokta. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c120"><span class="c0">Frost stepped forward and opened the polished case with a theatrical &nbsp;flourish. It was a masterful piece of craftsmanship. As the lid was pulled back, the &nbsp;many trays inside lifted and fanned out, displaying Glokta&rsquo;s tools in all their &nbsp;gruesome glory. There were blades of every size and shape, needles curved and &nbsp;straight, bottles of oil and acid, nails and screws, clamps and pliers, saws, &nbsp;hammers, chisels. Metal, wood and glass glittered in the bright lamplight, all &nbsp;polished to mirror brightness and honed to a murderous sharpness. A big purple &nbsp;swelling under Rews&rsquo; left eye had closed it completely, but the other darted over &nbsp;the instruments: terrified, fascinated. The functions of some were horribly &nbsp;obvious, the functions of others were horribly obscure. Which scare him more, I &nbsp;wonder? </span></p><p class="c59"><span class="c0">&lsquo;We were talking about your tooth, I think,&rsquo; murmured Glokta. Rews&rsquo; eye &nbsp;flicked up to look at him. &lsquo;Or would you like to confess?&rsquo; I have him, here he &nbsp;comes. Confess, confess, confess, confess . . . </span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c0">There was a sharp knock at the door. Damn it again! Frost opened it a crack &nbsp;and there was a brief whispering. Rews licked at his bloated lip. The door shut, &nbsp;the albino leaned to whisper in Glokta&rsquo;s ear. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c109"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Ith the Arth Ector.&rsquo; Glokta froze. The money was not enough. While I was &nbsp;shuffling back from Kalyne&rsquo;s office, the old bastard was reporting me to the Arch &nbsp;Lector. Am I finished then? He felt a guilty thrill at the thought. Well, I&rsquo;ll see to this &nbsp;fat pig first. </span></p><p class="c100"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Tell Severard I&rsquo;m on my way.&rsquo; Glokta turned back to talk to his prisoner, but &nbsp;Frost put a big white hand on his shoulder. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;O. The Arth Ector,&rsquo; Frost pointed to the door, &lsquo;he&rsquo;th ere. Ow.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">Here? Glokta could feel his eyelid twitching. Why? He pushed himself up using &nbsp;the edge of the table. Will they find me in the canal tomorrow? Dead and bloated, </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">far . . . far beyond recognition? The only emotion that he felt at the idea was a &nbsp;flutter of mild relief. No more stairs. </span></p><p class="c128"><span class="c0">The Arch Lector of His Majesty&rsquo;s Inquisition was standing outside in the &nbsp;corridor. The grimy walls looked almost brown behind him, so brilliantly &nbsp;spotless were his long white coat, his white gloves, his shock of white hair. He &nbsp;was past sixty, but showed none of the infirmity of age. Every tall, clean-shaven, &nbsp;fine-boned inch of him was immaculately turned out. He looks like a man who has &nbsp;never once in his life been surprised by anything. </span></p><p class="c285"><span class="c0">They had met once before, six years earlier when Glokta joined the &nbsp;Inquisition, and he hardly seemed to have changed. Arch Lector Sult. One of the &nbsp;most powerful men in the Union. One of the most powerful men in the world, come &nbsp;to that. Behind him, almost like outsized shadows, loomed two enormous, silent, &nbsp;black-masked Practicals. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c191"><span class="c0">The Arch Lector gave a thin smile when he saw Glokta shuffle out of his door. &nbsp;It said a lot, that smile. Mild scorn, mild pity, the very slightest touch of menace. &nbsp;Anything but amusement. &lsquo;Inquisitor Glokta,&rsquo; he said, holding out one white gloved hand, palm down. A ring with a huge purple stone flashed on his finger. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c311"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I serve and obey, your Eminence.&rsquo; Glokta could not help grimacing as he bent &nbsp;slowly forward to touch his lips to the ring. A difficult and painful manoeuvre, it &nbsp;seemed to take forever. When he finally hoisted himself back upright, Sult was &nbsp;gazing at him calmly with his cool blue eyes. A look that implied he already &nbsp;understood Glokta completely, and was unimpressed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c211"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Come with me.&rsquo; The Arch Lector turned and swept away down the corridor. &nbsp;Glokta limped along after him, the silent Practicals marching close behind. Sult &nbsp;moved with an effortless, languid confidence, coat tails flapping gracefully out &nbsp;behind him. Bastard. Soon they reached a door, much like his own. The Arch &nbsp;Lector unlocked it and went inside, the Practicals took up positions either side of &nbsp;the doorway, arms folded. A private interview then. One which I, perhaps, will &nbsp;never leave. Glokta stepped over the threshold. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c176"><span class="c0">A box of grubby white plaster too brightly lit and with a ceiling too low for &nbsp;comfort. It had a big crack instead of a damp patch, but was otherwise identical &nbsp;to his own room. It had the scarred table, the cheap chairs, it even had a poorly &nbsp;cleaned bloodstain. I wonder if they&rsquo;re painted on, for the effect? One of the </span></p><p class="c92"><span class="c0">Practicals suddenly pulled the door shut with a loud bang. Glokta was intended &nbsp;to jump, but he couldn&rsquo;t be bothered. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c265"><span class="c0">Arch Lector Sult lowered himself gracefully into one of the seats, drew a &nbsp;heavy sheaf of yellowing papers across the table towards him. He waved his &nbsp;hand at the other chair, the one that would be used by the prisoner. The &nbsp;implications were not lost on Glokta. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c75"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I prefer to stand, your Eminence.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c297"><span class="c0">Sult smiled at him. He had lovely, pointy teeth, all shiny white. &lsquo;No, you don&rsquo;t.&rsquo; &nbsp;He has me there. Glokta lowered himself ungracefully into the prisoner&rsquo;s chair &nbsp;while the Arch Lector turned over the first page of his wedge of documents, &nbsp;frowned and shook his head gently as though horribly disappointed by what he &nbsp;saw. The details of my illustrious career, perhaps? </span></p><p class="c122"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I had a visit from Superior Kalyne not long ago. He was most upset.&rsquo; Sult&rsquo;s &nbsp;hard blue eyes came up from his papers. &lsquo;Upset with you, Glokta. He was quite &nbsp;vocal on the subject. He told me that you are an uncontrollable menace, that you &nbsp;act without a thought for the consequences, that you are a mad cripple. He &nbsp;demanded that you be removed from his department.&rsquo; The Arch Lector smiled, a &nbsp;cold, nasty smile, the kind Glokta used on his prisoners. But with more teeth. &lsquo;I &nbsp;think he had it in mind that you be removed . . . altogether.&rsquo; They stared at each &nbsp;other across the table. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c136"><span class="c0">Is this where I beg for mercy? Is this where I crawl on the ground and kiss your &nbsp;feet? Well, I don&rsquo;t care enough to beg and I&rsquo;m far too stiff to crawl. Your Practicals &nbsp;will have to kill me sitting down. Cut my throat. Bash my head in. Whatever. As long &nbsp;as they get on with it. </span></p><p class="c169"><span class="c0">But Sult was in no rush. The white-gloved hands moved neatly, precisely, the &nbsp;pages hissed and crackled. &lsquo;We have few men like you in the Inquisition, Glokta. &nbsp;A nobleman, from an excellent family. A champion swordsman, a dashing cavalry &nbsp;officer. A man once groomed for the very top.&rsquo; Sult looked him up and down as &nbsp;though he could hardly believe it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;That was before the war, Arch Lector.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c101"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Obviously. There was much dismay at your capture, and little hope that you &nbsp;would be returned alive. As the war dragged on and the months passed, hope &nbsp;diminished to nothing, but when the treaty was signed, you were among those </span></p><p class="c254"><span class="c0">prisoners returned to the Union.&rsquo; He peered at Glokta through narrowed eyes. &nbsp;&lsquo;Did you talk?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c230"><span class="c0">Glokta couldn&rsquo;t help himself, he spluttered with shrill laughter. It echoed &nbsp;strangely in the cold room. Not a sound you often heard down here. &lsquo;Did I talk? I &nbsp;talked until my throat was raw. I told them everything I could think of. I &nbsp;screamed every secret I&rsquo;d ever heard. I babbled like a fool. When I ran out of &nbsp;things to tell them I made things up. I pissed myself and cried like a girl. &nbsp;Everyone does.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c125"><span class="c0">&lsquo;But not everyone survives. Two years in the Emperor&rsquo;s prisons. No one else &nbsp;lasted half that long. The physicians were sure you would never leave your bed &nbsp;again, but a year later you made your application to the Inquisition.&rsquo; We both &nbsp;know it. We were both there. What do you want from me, and why not get on with &nbsp;it? I suppose some men just love the sound of their own voices. </span></p><p class="c197"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I was told that you were crippled, that you were broken, that you could never &nbsp;be mended, that you could never be trusted. But I was inclined to give you a &nbsp;chance. Some fool wins the Contest every year, and wars produce many &nbsp;promising soldiers, but your achievement in surviving those two years was &nbsp;unique. So you were sent to the North, and put in charge of one of our mines &nbsp;there. What did you make of Angland?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c84"><span class="c0">A filthy sink of violence and corruption. A prison where we have made slaves of &nbsp;the innocent and guilty alike in the name of freedom. A stinking hole where we send &nbsp;those we hate and those we are ashamed of to die of hunger, and disease, and hard &nbsp;labour. &lsquo;It was cold,&rsquo; said Glokta. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c45"><span class="c0">&lsquo;And so were you. You made few friends in Angland. Precious few among the &nbsp;Inquisition, and none among the exiles.&rsquo; He plucked a tattered letter from among &nbsp;the papers and cast a critical eye over it. &lsquo;Superior Goyle told me that you were a &nbsp;cold fish, had no blood in you at all. He thought you&rsquo;d never amount to anything, &nbsp;that he could make no use of you.&rsquo; Goyle. That bastard. That butcher. I&rsquo;d rather &nbsp;have no blood than no brains. </span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c0">&lsquo;But after three years, production was up. It was doubled in fact. So you were &nbsp;brought back to Adua, to work under Superior Kalyne. I thought perhaps you &nbsp;would learn discipline with him, but it seems I was wrong. You insist on going &nbsp;your own way.&rsquo; The Arch Lector frowned up at him. &lsquo;To be frank, I think that </span></p><p class="c134"><span class="c0">Kalyne is afraid of you. I think they all are. They don&rsquo;t like your arrogance, they &nbsp;don&rsquo;t like your methods, they don&rsquo;t like your . . . special insight into our work.&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;And what do you think, Arch Lector?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c105"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Honestly? I&rsquo;m not sure I like your methods much either, and I doubt that &nbsp;your arrogance is entirely deserved. But I like your results. I like your results &nbsp;very much.&rsquo; He slapped the bundle of papers closed and rested one hand on top &nbsp;of it, leaning across the table towards Glokta. As I might lean towards my &nbsp;prisoners when I ask them to confess. &lsquo;I have a task for you. A task that should &nbsp;make better use of your talents than chasing around after petty smugglers. A task &nbsp;that may allow you to redeem yourself in the eyes of the Inquisition.&rsquo; The Arch &nbsp;Lector paused for a long moment. &lsquo;I want you to arrest Sepp dan Teufel.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c281"><span class="c0">Glokta frowned. Teufel? &lsquo;The Master of the Mints, your Eminence?&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;The very same.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c0">The Master of the Royal Mints. An important man from an important family. A &nbsp;very big fish, to be hooked in my little tank. A fish with powerful friends. It could be &nbsp;dangerous, arresting a man like that. It could be fatal. &lsquo;May I ask why?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c216"><span class="c0">&lsquo;You may not. Let me worry about the whys. You concentrate on obtaining a &nbsp;confession.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">&lsquo;A confession to what, Arch Lector?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Why, to corruption and high treason! It seems our friend the Master of the &nbsp;Mints has been most indiscreet in some of his personal dealings. It seems he has &nbsp;been taking bribes, conspiring with the Guild of Mercers to defraud the King. As &nbsp;such, it would be very useful if a ranking Mercer were to name him, in some &nbsp;unfortunate connection.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c113"><span class="c0">It can hardly be a coincidence that I have a ranking Mercer in my interrogation &nbsp;room, even as we speak. Glokta shrugged. &lsquo;Once people start talking, it&rsquo;s shocking &nbsp;the names that tumble out.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c158"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Good.&rsquo; The Arch Lector waved his hand. &lsquo;You may go, Inquisitor. I will come &nbsp;for Teufel&rsquo;s confession this time tomorrow. You had better have it.&rsquo; &nbsp;Glokta breathed slowly as he laboured back along the corridor. &nbsp;Breath in, breath out. Calm. He had not expected to leave that room alive. And &nbsp;now I find myself moving in powerful circles. A personal task for the Arch Lector, &nbsp;squeezing a confession to high treason from one of the Union&rsquo;s most trusted </span></p><p class="c146"><span class="c0">officials. The most powerful of circles, but for how long? Why me? Because of my &nbsp;results? </span></p><p class="c106"><span class="c0">Or because I won&rsquo;t be missed? </span></p><p class="c249"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I apologise for all the interruptions today, really I do, it&rsquo;s like a brothel in here &nbsp;with all the coming and going.&rsquo; Rews twisted his cracked and swollen lips into a &nbsp;sad smile. Smiling at a time like this, he&rsquo;s a marvel. But all things must end. &lsquo;Let us &nbsp;be honest, Rews. No one is coming to help you. Not today, not tomorrow, not &nbsp;ever. You will confess. The only choices you have are when, and the state you&rsquo;ll &nbsp;be in when you do. There&rsquo;s really nothing to be gained by putting it off. Except &nbsp;pain. We&rsquo;ve got lots of that for you.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c96"><span class="c0">It was hard to read the expression on Rews&rsquo; bloody face, but his shoulders &nbsp;sagged. He dipped the pen in the ink with a trembling hand, wrote his name, &nbsp;slightly slanted, across the bottom of the paper of confession. I win again. Does &nbsp;my leg hurt any less? Do I have my teeth back? Has it helped me to destroy this &nbsp;man, who I once called a friend? Then why do I do this? The scratching of the nib &nbsp;on the paper was the only reply. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c139"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Excellent,&rsquo; said Glokta. Practical Frost turned the document over. &lsquo;And this is &nbsp;the list of your accomplices?&rsquo; He let his eye scan lazily over the names. A handful &nbsp;of junior Mercers, three ship&rsquo;s captains, an officer of the city watch, a pair of minor &nbsp;customs officials. A tedious recipe indeed. Let us see if we can add some &nbsp;spice. Glokta turned it around and pushed it back across the table. &lsquo;Add Sepp dan &nbsp;Teufel&rsquo;s name to the list, Rews.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c286"><span class="c0">The fat man looked confused. &lsquo;The Master of the Mints?&rsquo; he mumbled, through &nbsp;his thick lips. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the one.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c116"><span class="c0">&lsquo;But I never met the man.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c0">&lsquo;So?&rsquo; snapped Glokta. &lsquo;Do as I tell you.&rsquo; Rews paused, mouth a little open. &nbsp;&lsquo;Write, you fat pig.&rsquo; Practical Frost cracked his knuckles. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c88"><span class="c0">Rews licked his lips. &lsquo;Sepp . . . dan . . . Teufel,&rsquo; he mumbled to himself as he &nbsp;wrote. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c345"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Excellent.&rsquo; Glokta carefully shut the lid on his horrible, beautiful instruments. &nbsp;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad for both our sakes that we won&rsquo;t be needing these today.&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c0">Frost snapped the manacles shut on the prisoner&rsquo;s wrists and dragged him to &nbsp;his feet, started to march him toward the door at the back of the room. &lsquo;What &nbsp;now?&rsquo; shouted Rews over his shoulder. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c187"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Angland, Rews, Angland. Don&rsquo;t forget to pack something warm.&rsquo; The door &nbsp;cracked shut behind him. Glokta looked at the list of names in his hands. Sepp &nbsp;dan Teufel&rsquo;s sat at the bottom. One name. On the face of it, just like the others. &nbsp;Teufel. Just one more name. But such a perilous one. </span></p><p class="c196"><span class="c0">Severard was waiting outside in the corridor, smiling as always. &lsquo;Shall I put &nbsp;the fat man in the canal?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;No, Severard. Put him in the next boat to Angland.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&lsquo;You&rsquo;re in a merciful mood today, Inquisitor.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c226"><span class="c0">Glokta snorted. &lsquo;Mercy would be the canal. That swine won&rsquo;t last six weeks in &nbsp;the North. Forget him. We have to arrest Sepp dan Teufel tonight.&rsquo; &nbsp;Severard&rsquo;s eyebrows rose. &lsquo;Not the Master of the Mints?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c56"><span class="c0">&lsquo;None other. On the express orders of his Eminence the Arch Lector. It seems &nbsp;he&rsquo;s been taking money from the Mercers.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Oh, for shame.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll leave as soon as it gets dark. Tell Frost to be ready.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c193"><span class="c0">The thin Practical nodded, his long hair swaying. Glokta turned and hobbled &nbsp;up the corridor, cane tapping on the grimy tiles, left leg burning. &nbsp;Why do I do this? He asked himself again. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c312"><span class="c0">Why do I do this?</span></p><p class="c50"><span class="c1">No Choice at All </span></p><p class="c291"><span class="c0">Logen woke with a painful jolt. He was lying awkwardly, head twisted against &nbsp;something hard, knees drawn up towards his chest. He opened his eyes a bleary &nbsp;crack. It was dark, but there was a faint glow coming from somewhere. Light &nbsp;through snow. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Panic stabbed at him. He knew where he was now. He&rsquo;d piled some snow in &nbsp;the entrance to the tiny cave, to try and keep in the warmth, such as it was. It &nbsp;must have snowed while he was sleeping, and sealed him in. If the fall had been a &nbsp;heavy one there could be a lot of snow out there. Drifts deeper than a man was &nbsp;tall. He might never get out. He could have climbed all the way up out of the high &nbsp;valleys just to die in a hole in the rock, too cramped for him to even stretch out &nbsp;his legs. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c89"><span class="c0">Logen twisted round in the narrow space as best he could, dug away at the &nbsp;snow with his numb hands, floundering at it, grappling with it, hacking through &nbsp;it, mouthing breathless curses to himself. Light spilled in suddenly, searing &nbsp;bright. He shoved the last of the snow out of the way and dragged himself &nbsp;through into the open air. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c268"><span class="c0">The sky was a brilliant blue, the sun was blazing overhead. He turned his face &nbsp;towards it, closed his stinging eyes and let the light wash over him. The air was &nbsp;painful cold in his throat. Cutting cold. His mouth was dry as dust, his tongue a &nbsp;piece of wood, badly carved. He scooped up snow and shoved it into his mouth. It &nbsp;melted, he swallowed. Cold, it made his head hurt. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c287"><span class="c0">There was a graveyard stink coming from somewhere. Not just his own damp &nbsp;and sour sweat smell, though that was bad enough. It was the blanket, starting to &nbsp;rot. He had two pieces of it wrapped round his hands like mittens, tied round his &nbsp;wrists with twine, another round his head, like a dirty, foul-smelling hood. His &nbsp;boots were stuffed tight with it. The rest was wrapped round and round his body, &nbsp;under his coat. It smelled bad, but it had saved his life last night, and that was a &nbsp;good trade to Logen&rsquo;s mind. It would stink a good deal more before he could &nbsp;afford to get rid of it. </span></p><p class="c107"><span class="c0">He floundered to his feet and stared about. A narrow valley, steep sided and &nbsp;choked with snow. Three great peaks surrounded it, piles of dark grey stone and &nbsp;white snow against the blue sky. He knew them. Old friends, in fact. The only &nbsp;ones he had left. He was up in the High Places. The roof of the world. He was safe. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Safe,&rsquo; he croaked to himself, but without much joy. Safe from food, certainly. &nbsp;Safe from warmth, without a doubt. Neither of those things would be troubling &nbsp;him up here. He&rsquo;d escaped the Shanka, maybe, but this was a place for the dead, &nbsp;and if he stayed he&rsquo;d be joining them. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c214"><span class="c0">He was brutal hungry as it was. His belly was a great, painful hole that called &nbsp;to him with piercing cries. He fumbled in his pack for the last strip of meat. An &nbsp;old, brown, greasy thing like a dry twig. That would hardly fill the gap, but it was &nbsp;all he had. He tore at it with his teeth, tough as old boot leather, and choked it &nbsp;down with some snow. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c322"><span class="c0">Logen shielded his eyes with his arm and looked northward down the valley, &nbsp;the way he&rsquo;d come the day before. The ground dropped slowly away, snow and &nbsp;rock giving way to the pine-covered fells of the high valleys, trees giving way to a &nbsp;crinkled strip of grazing land, grassy hills giving way to the sea, a sparkling line &nbsp;on the far horizon. Home. The thought of it made Logen feel sick. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c142"><span class="c0">Home. That was where his family was. His father &ndash; wise and strong, a good &nbsp;man, a good leader to his people. His wife, his children. They were a good family. &nbsp;They deserved a better son, a better husband, a better father. His friends were &nbsp;there too. Old and new together. It would be good to see them all again, very &nbsp;good. To speak to his father in the long hall. To play with his children, to sit with &nbsp;his wife by the river. To talk of tactics with Threetrees. To hunt with the Dogman &nbsp;in the high valleys, crashing through the forest with a spear, laughing like a fool. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c331"><span class="c0">Logen felt a sudden painful longing. He nearly choked on the pain of it. &nbsp;Trouble was, they were all dead. The hall was a ring of black splinters, the river a &nbsp;sewer. He&rsquo;d never forget coming over the hill, seeing the burnt-out ruin in the &nbsp;valley below. Crawling through the ashes, fumbling for signs that someone got &nbsp;away, while the Dogman pulled at his shoulder and told him to give it up. Nothing &nbsp;but corpses, rotted past knowing. He was done looking for signs. They were all &nbsp;dead as the Shanka could make them, and that was dead for sure. He spat in the </span></p><p class="c250"><span class="c0">snow, brown spit from the dry meat. Dead and cold and rotted, or burned to &nbsp;ashes. Gone back to the mud. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c232"><span class="c0">Logen set his jaw and clenched his fists under the rotten shreds of blanket. He &nbsp;could go back to the ruins of the village by the sea, just one last time. He could &nbsp;charge down with a fighting roar in his throat, the way he had done at Carleon, &nbsp;when he&rsquo;d lost a finger and won a reputation. He could put a few Shanka out of &nbsp;the world. Split them like he&rsquo;d split Shama Heartless, shoulder to guts so his &nbsp;insides fell out. He could get vengeance for his father, his wife, his children, his &nbsp;friends. That would be a fitting end for the one they called the Bloody-Nine. To &nbsp;die killing. That might be a song worth the singing. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c0">But at Carleon he&rsquo;d been young and strong, and with his friends behind him. &nbsp;Now he was weak, and hungry, and alone as could be. He&rsquo;d killed Shama &nbsp;Heartless with a long sword, sharp as anything. He looked down at his knife. It &nbsp;might be a good one, but he&rsquo;d get precious little vengeance with it. And who&rsquo;d &nbsp;sing the song anyway? The Shanka had poor singing voices and worse &nbsp;imaginations, if they even recognised the stinking beggar in the blanket after &nbsp;they&rsquo;d shot him full of arrows. Perhaps the vengeance could wait, at least until he &nbsp;had a bigger blade to work with. You have to be realistic, after all. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c270"><span class="c0">South then, and become a wanderer. There was always work for a man with &nbsp;his skills. Hard work perhaps, and dark, but work all the same. There was an &nbsp;appeal in it, he had to admit. To have no one depending on him but himself, for &nbsp;his decisions to hold no importance, for no one&rsquo;s life or death to be in his hands. &nbsp;He had enemies in the south, that was a fact. But the Bloody-Nine had dealt with &nbsp;enemies before. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c264"><span class="c0">He spat again. Now that he had some spit he thought he might make the most &nbsp;of it. It was about all he did have &ndash; spit, an old pot, and some stinking bits of &nbsp;blanket. Dead in the north or alive in the south. That was what it came down to, &nbsp;and that was no choice at all. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c86"><span class="c0">You carry on. That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;d always done. That&rsquo;s the task that comes with &nbsp;surviving, whether you deserve to live or not. You remember the dead as best &nbsp;you can. You say some words for them. Then you carry on, and you hope for &nbsp;better. </span></p><p class="c184"><span class="c0">Logen took in a long, cold breath, and blew it out. &lsquo;Fare you well, my friends,&rsquo; &nbsp;he muttered. &lsquo;Fare you well.&rsquo; Then he threw his pack over his shoulder, turned, &nbsp;and began to flounder through the deep snow. Downwards, southwards, out of &nbsp;the mountains. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c207"><span class="c0">It was raining, still. A soft rain that coated everything in cold dew, collected on &nbsp;the branches, on the leaves, on the needles, and dripped off in great fat drops &nbsp;that soaked through Logen&rsquo;s wet clothes and onto his wet skin. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c150"><span class="c0">He squatted, still and silent, in the damp brush, water running down his face, &nbsp;the bright blade of his knife glistening with wet. He felt the great motion of the &nbsp;forest and heard all its thousand sounds. The countless crawling of the insects, &nbsp;the blind scuttling of the moles, the timid rustling of the deer, the slow pulsing of &nbsp;the sap in the old tree trunks. Each thing alive in the forest was in search of its &nbsp;own kind of food, and he was the same. He let his mind settle on an animal close &nbsp;to him, moving cautiously through the woods to his right. Delicious. The forest &nbsp;grew silent but for the endless dripping of water from the branches. The world &nbsp;shrank down to Logen and his next meal. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c318"><span class="c0">When he reckoned it was close enough, he sprang forward and bore it down &nbsp;onto the wet ground. A young deer. It kicked and struggled but he was strong and &nbsp;quick, and he stabbed his knife into its neck and chopped the throat out. Hot &nbsp;blood surged from the wound, spilled out across Logen&rsquo;s hands, onto the wet &nbsp;earth. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c210"><span class="c0">He picked up the carcass and slung it over his shoulders. That would be good &nbsp;in a stew, maybe with some mushrooms. Very good. Then, once he&rsquo;d eaten, he &nbsp;would ask the spirits for guidance. Their guidance was pretty useless, but the &nbsp;company would be welcome. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c313"><span class="c0">When he reached his camp it was close to sunset. It was a dwelling fit for a &nbsp;hero of Logen&rsquo;s stature &ndash; two big sticks holding a load of damp branches over a &nbsp;hollow in the dirt. Still, it was halfway dry in there, and the rain had stopped. He &nbsp;would have a fire tonight. It was a long time since he&rsquo;d had a treat like that. A fire, &nbsp;and all his own. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c87"><span class="c0">Later, well fed and rested, Logen pressed a lump of chagga into his pipe. He&rsquo;d &nbsp;found it growing a few days before at the base of a tree, big moist yellow discs of &nbsp;it. He&rsquo;d broken off a good chunk for himself, but it hadn&rsquo;t dried out enough to </span></p><p class="c215"><span class="c0">smoke until today. Now he took a burning twig from the fire and stuck it in the &nbsp;bowl, puffing away hard until the fungus caught and began to burn, giving off its &nbsp;familiar earthy-sweet smell. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c257"><span class="c0">Logen coughed, blew out brown smoke and stared into the shifting flames. &nbsp;His mind went back to other times and other campfires. The Dogman was there, &nbsp;grinning, the light gleaming on his pointy teeth. Tul Duru was sitting opposite, &nbsp;big as a mountain, laughing like thunder. Forley the Weakest too, with those &nbsp;nervous eyes darting around, always a little scared. Rudd Threetrees was there, &nbsp;and Harding Grim, saying nothing. He never did say anything. That was why they &nbsp;called him Grim. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c199"><span class="c0">They were all there. Only they weren&rsquo;t. They were all dead, gone back to the &nbsp;mud. Logen tapped the pipe out into the fire and shoved it away. He had no taste &nbsp;for it now. His father had been right. You should never smoke alone. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c279"><span class="c0">He unscrewed the cap of the battered flask, took a mouthful, and blew it out &nbsp;in a spray of tiny drops. A gout of flame went up into the cold air. Logen wiped &nbsp;his lips, savouring the hot, bitter taste. Then he sat back against the knotted &nbsp;trunk of a pine, and waited. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c319"><span class="c0">It was a while before they came. Three of them. They came silently from the &nbsp;dancing shadows among the trees and made slowly for the fire, taking shape as &nbsp;they moved into the light. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c75"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Ninefingers,&rsquo; said the first. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Ninefingers,&rsquo; the second. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c233"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Ninefingers,&rsquo; the third, voices like the thousand sounds of the forest. &nbsp;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re right welcome to my fire,&rsquo; said Logen. The spirits squatted and stared &nbsp;at him without expression. &lsquo;Only three tonight?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c110"><span class="c0">The one on the right spoke first. &lsquo;Every year fewer of us wake from the &nbsp;winter. We are all that remain. A few more winters will pass, and we will sleep &nbsp;also. There will be none of us left to answer your call.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c106"><span class="c0">Logen nodded sadly. &lsquo;Any news from the world?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c74"><span class="c0">&lsquo;We heard a man fell off a cliff but washed up alive, then crossed the High &nbsp;Places at the start of spring, wrapped in a rotten blanket, but we put no faith in &nbsp;such rumours.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c75"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Very wise.&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c208"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Bethod has been making war,&rsquo; said the spirit in the centre. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c83"><span class="c0">Logen frowned. &lsquo;Bethod is always making war. That&rsquo;s what he does.&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;Yes. He has won so many fights now, with your help, he has given himself a &nbsp;golden hat.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c247"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Shit on that bastard,&rsquo; said Logen, spitting into the fire. &lsquo;What else?&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;North of the mountains, the Shanka run around and burn things.&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;They love the fire,&rsquo; said the spirit in the centre. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c276"><span class="c0">&lsquo;They do,&rsquo; said the one on the left, &lsquo;even more than your kind, Ninefingers. &nbsp;They love and fear it.&rsquo; The spirit leaned forwards. &lsquo;We heard there is a man &nbsp;seeking for you in the moors to the south.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;A powerful man,&rsquo; said the one in the centre. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c116"><span class="c0">&lsquo;A Magus of the Old Time,&rsquo; the one on the left. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c330"><span class="c0">Logen frowned. He&rsquo;d heard of these Magi. He met a sorcerer once, but he&rsquo;d &nbsp;been easy to kill. No unnatural powers in particular, not that Logen had noticed. &nbsp;But a Magus was something else. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c229"><span class="c0">&lsquo;We heard that the Magi are wise and strong,&rsquo; said the spirit in the centre, &nbsp;&lsquo;and that such a one could take a man far and show him many things. But they &nbsp;are crafty too, and have their own purposes.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">&lsquo;What does he want?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Ask him.&rsquo; Spirits cared little for the business of men, they were always weak &nbsp;on the details. Still, this was better than the usual talk about trees. &nbsp;&lsquo;What will you do, Ninefingers?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c85"><span class="c0">Logen considered a moment. &lsquo;I will go south and find this Magus, and ask him &nbsp;what he wants from me.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c340"><span class="c0">The spirits nodded. They didn&rsquo;t show whether they thought it was a good &nbsp;idea or bad. They didn&rsquo;t care. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c78"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Farewell then, Ninefingers,&rsquo; said the spirit on the right, &lsquo;perhaps for the last &nbsp;time.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try to struggle on without you.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c175"><span class="c0">Logen&rsquo;s wit was wasted on them. They rose and moved away from the fire, &nbsp;fading gradually into the darkness. Soon they were gone, but Logen had to admit &nbsp;they had been more use than he dared to hope. They had given him a purpose. </span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c0">He would head south in the morning, head south and find this Magus. Who &nbsp;knew? He might be a good talker. Had to be better than being shot full of arrows &nbsp;for nothing, at least. Logen looked into the flames, nodding slowly to himself. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c346"><span class="c0">He remembered other times and other campfires, when he had not been &nbsp;alone. </span></p><p class="c50"><span class="c1">Playing With Knives </span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c0">It was a beautiful spring day in Adua, and the sun shone pleasantly through the &nbsp;branches of the aromatic cedar, casting a dappled shade on the players beneath. &nbsp;A pleasing breeze fluttered through the courtyard, so the cards were clutched &nbsp;tightly or weighted down with glasses or coins. Birds twittered from the trees, &nbsp;and the shears of a gardener clacked across from the far side of the lawn, making &nbsp;faint, agreeable echoes against the tall white buildings of the quadrangle. &nbsp;Whether or not the players found the large sum of money in the centre of the &nbsp;table pleasant depended, of course, on the cards they held. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c209"><span class="c0">Captain Jezal dan Luthar certainly liked it. He had discovered an uncanny &nbsp;talent for the game since he gained his commission in the King&rsquo;s Own, a talent &nbsp;which he had used to win large sums of money from his comrades. He didn&rsquo;t &nbsp;really need the money, of course, coming from such a wealthy family, but it had &nbsp;allowed him to maintain an illusion of thrift while spending like a sailor. &nbsp;Whenever Jezal went home, his father bored everyone on the subject of his good &nbsp;fiscal planning, and had rewarded him by buying his Captaincy just six months &nbsp;ago. His brothers had not been happy. Yes, the money was certainly useful, and &nbsp;there&rsquo;s nothing half so amusing as humiliating one&rsquo;s closest friends. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c82"><span class="c0">Jezal half sat, half lay back on his bench with one leg stretched out, and &nbsp;allowed his eyes to wander over the other players. Major West had rocked his &nbsp;chair so far onto its back legs that he looked in imminent danger of tipping over &nbsp;entirely. He was holding his glass up to the sun, admiring the way that the light &nbsp;filtered through the amber spirit inside. He had a faint, mysterious smile which &nbsp;seemed to say, &lsquo;I am not a nobleman, and may be your social inferior, but I won a &nbsp;Contest and the King&rsquo;s favour on the battlefield and that makes me the better &nbsp;man, so you children will damn well do as I say.&rsquo; He was out of this hand though, &nbsp;and, in Jezal&rsquo;s opinion, far too cautious with his money anyway. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c299"><span class="c0">Lieutenant Kaspa was sitting forward, frowning and scratching his sandy &nbsp;beard, staring intently at his cards as though they were sums he didn&rsquo;t &nbsp;understand. He was a good-humoured young man but an oaf of a card player, and </span></p><p class="c121 c292"><span class="c0">was always most appreciative when Jezal bought him drinks with his own &nbsp;money. Still, he could well afford to lose it: his father was one of the biggest &nbsp;landowners in the Union. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c46"><span class="c0">Jezal had often observed that the ever so slightly stupid will act more stupidly &nbsp;in clever company. Having lost the high ground already they scramble eagerly for &nbsp;the position of likeable idiot, stay out of arguments they will only lose, and can &nbsp;hence be everyone&rsquo;s friend. Kaspa&rsquo;s look of baffled concentration seemed to say, &nbsp;&lsquo;I am not clever, but honest and likeable, which is much more important. &nbsp;Cleverness is overrated. Oh, and I&rsquo;m very, very rich, so everyone likes me &nbsp;regardless.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c64"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll stay with you,&rsquo; said Kaspa, and tossed a small stack of silver coins &nbsp;onto the table. They broke and flashed in the sun with a cheerful jingle. Jezal &nbsp;absently added up the total in his head. A new uniform perhaps? Kaspa always &nbsp;got a little quivery when he really held good cards, and he was not trembling &nbsp;now. To say that he was bluffing was to give him far too much credit; more likely &nbsp;he was simply bored with sitting out. Jezal had no doubt that he would fold up &nbsp;like a cheap tent on the next round of betting. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c301"><span class="c0">Lieutenant Jalenhorm scowled and tossed his cards onto the table. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had &nbsp;nothing but shit today!&rsquo; he rumbled. He sat back in his chair and hunched his &nbsp;brawny shoulders with a frown that said, &lsquo;I am big and manly, and have a quick &nbsp;temper, so I should be treated with respect by everyone.&rsquo; Respect was precisely &nbsp;what Jezal never gave him at the card table. A bad temper might be useful in a &nbsp;fight, but it&rsquo;s a liability where money is concerned. It was a shame his hand &nbsp;hadn&rsquo;t been a little better, or Jezal could&rsquo;ve bullied him out of half his pay. &nbsp;Jalenhorm drained his glass and reached for the bottle. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c94"><span class="c0">That just left Brint, the youngest and poorest of the group. He licked his lips &nbsp;with an expression at once careful and slightly desperate, an expression which &nbsp;seemed to say, &lsquo;I am not young or poor. I can afford to lose this money. I am every &nbsp;bit as important as the rest of you.&rsquo; He had a lot of money today; perhaps his &nbsp;allowance had just come in. Perhaps that was all he had to live on for the next &nbsp;couple of months. Jezal planned to take that money away from him and waste it &nbsp;all on women and drink. He had to stop himself giggling at the thought. He could </span></p><p class="c239"><span class="c0">giggle when he&rsquo;d won the hand. Brint sat back and considered carefully. He might &nbsp;be some time making his decision, so Jezal took his pipe from the table. &nbsp;He lit it at the lamp provided especially for that purpose and blew ragged &nbsp;smoke rings up into the branches of the cedar. He wasn&rsquo;t half as good at smoking &nbsp;as he was at cards, unfortunately, and most of the rings were no more than ugly &nbsp;puffs of yellow-brown vapour. If he was being completely honest, he didn&rsquo;t really &nbsp;enjoy smoking. It made him feel a bit sick, but it was very fashionable and very &nbsp;expensive, and Jezal would be damned if he would miss out on something &nbsp;fashionable just because he didn&rsquo;t like it. Besides, his father had bought him a &nbsp;beautiful ivory pipe the last time he was in the city, and it looked very well on &nbsp;him. His brothers had not been happy about that either, come to think of it. &nbsp;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m in,&rsquo; said Brint. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c339"><span class="c0">Jezal swung his leg off the bench. &lsquo;Then I raise you a hundred marks or so.&rsquo; He &nbsp;shoved his whole stack into the centre of the table. West sucked air through his &nbsp;teeth. A coin fell from the top of the pile, landed on its edge and rolled along the &nbsp;wood. It dropped to the flags beneath with the unmistakeable sound of falling &nbsp;money. The head of the gardener on the other side of the lawn snapped up &nbsp;instinctively, before he returned to his clipping of the grass. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c173"><span class="c0">Kaspa shoved his cards away as though they were burning his fingers and &nbsp;shook his head. &lsquo;Damn it but I&rsquo;m an oaf of a card player,&rsquo; he lamented, and leaned &nbsp;back against the rough brown trunk of the tree. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c256"><span class="c0">Jezal stared straight at Lieutenant Brint, a slight smile on his face, giving &nbsp;nothing away. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s bluffing,&rsquo; rumbled Jalenhorm, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t let him push you around, &nbsp;Brint.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c222"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, Lieutenant,&rsquo; said West, but Jezal knew he would. He had to look as &nbsp;if he could afford to lose. Brint didn&rsquo;t hesitate, he pushed all his own coins in with &nbsp;a careless flourish. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c98"><span class="c0">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a hundred, give or take.&rsquo; Brint was trying his hardest to sound &nbsp;masterful in front of the older officers, but his voice had a charming note of &nbsp;hysteria. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c323"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Good enough,&rsquo; said Jezal, &lsquo;we&rsquo;re all friends here. What do you have, &nbsp;Lieutenant?&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c73"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I have earth.&rsquo; Brint&rsquo;s eyes had a slightly feverish look to them as he showed &nbsp;his cards to the group. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c192"><span class="c0">Jezal savoured the tense atmosphere. He frowned, shrugged, raised his &nbsp;eyebrows. He scratched his head thoughtfully. He watched Brint&rsquo;s expression &nbsp;change as he changed his own. Hope, despair, hope, despair. At length Jezal &nbsp;spread his cards out on the table. &lsquo;Oh look. I have suns, again.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c0">Brint&rsquo;s face was a picture. West gave a sigh and shook his head. Jalenhorm &nbsp;frowned. &lsquo;I was sure he was bluffing,&rsquo; he said. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c341"><span class="c0">&lsquo;How does he do it?&rsquo; asked Kaspa, flicking a stray coin across the table. &nbsp;Jezal shrugged. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all about the players, and nothing about the cards.&rsquo; He &nbsp;began to scoop up the heap of silver while Brint looked on, teeth gritted, face &nbsp;pale. The money jingled into the bag with a pleasant sound. Pleasant to Jezal, &nbsp;anyway. A coin dropped from the table and fell next to Brint&rsquo;s boot. &lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t &nbsp;fetch that for me could you Lieutenant?&rsquo; asked Jezal, with a syrupy smile. &nbsp;Brint stood up quickly, knocking into the table and making the coins and &nbsp;glasses jump and rattle. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve things to do,&rsquo; he said in a thick voice, then &nbsp;shouldered roughly past Jezal, barging him against the trunk of the tree, and &nbsp;strode off toward the edge of the courtyard. He disappeared into the officers&rsquo; &nbsp;quarters, head down. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c147"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Did you see that?&rsquo; Jezal was becoming ever more indignant with each passing &nbsp;moment. &lsquo;Barging me like that, it&rsquo;s damn impolite! And me his superior officer as &nbsp;well! I&rsquo;ve a good mind to put him on report!&rsquo; A chorus of disapproving sounds &nbsp;greeted this mention of reports. &lsquo;Well, he&rsquo;s a bad loser is all!&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c309"><span class="c0">Jalenhorm looked sternly out from beneath his brows. &lsquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t bite him &nbsp;so hard. He isn&rsquo;t rich. He can&rsquo;t afford to lose.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c97"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Well if he can&rsquo;t afford to lose he shouldn&rsquo;t play!&rsquo; snapped Jezal, upset. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s &nbsp;the one told him I was bluffing? You should keep your big mouth shut!&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s new here,&rsquo; said West, &lsquo;he just wants to fit in. Weren&rsquo;t you new once?&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;What are you, my father?&rsquo; Jezal remembered being new with painful clarity, &nbsp;and the mention of it made him feel just a little ashamed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c277"><span class="c0">Kaspa waved his hand. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll lend him some money, don&rsquo;t worry.&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;He won&rsquo;t take it,&rsquo; said Jalenhorm. </span></p><p class="c79"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s his business.&rsquo; Kaspa closed his eyes and turned his face up to the &nbsp;sun. &lsquo;Hot. Winter is truly over. Must be getting past midday.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Shit!&rsquo; shouted Jezal, starting up and gathering his things. The gardener &nbsp;paused in his trimming of the lawn and looked over at them. &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say &nbsp;something, West?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c75"><span class="c0">&lsquo;What am I, your father?&rsquo; asked the Major. Kaspa sniggered. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c233"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Late again,&rsquo; said Jalenhorm, blowing out his cheeks. &lsquo;The Lord Marshal will &nbsp;not be happy!&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c70"><span class="c0">Jezal snatched up his fencing steels and ran for the far side of the lawn. Major &nbsp;West ambled after him. &lsquo;Come on!&rsquo; shouted Jezal. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m right behind you, Captain,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Right behind you.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c137"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Jab, jab, Jezal, jab, jab!&rsquo; barked Lord Marshal Varuz, whacking him on the arm &nbsp;with his stick. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Ow,&rsquo; yelped Jezal, and hefted the metal bar again. </span></p><p class="c143"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I want to see that right arm moving, Captain, darting like a snake! I want to &nbsp;be blinded by the speed of those hands!&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c234"><span class="c0">Jezal made a couple more clumsy lunges with the unwieldy lump of iron. It &nbsp;was utter torture. His fingers, his wrist, his forearm, his shoulder, were burning &nbsp;with the effort. He was soaked to the skin with sweat; it flew from his face in big &nbsp;drops. Marshal Varuz flicked his feeble efforts away. &lsquo;Now, cut! Cut with the left!&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c194"><span class="c0">Jezal swung the big smith&rsquo;s hammer at the old man&rsquo;s head with all the &nbsp;strength in his left arm. He could barely lift the damn thing on a good day. &nbsp;Marshal Varuz stepped effortlessly aside and whacked him in the face with the &nbsp;stick. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c258"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Yow!&rsquo; wailed Jezal, as he stumbled back. He fumbled the hammer and it &nbsp;dropped on his foot. &lsquo;Aaargh!&rsquo; The iron bar clanged to the floor as he bent down &nbsp;to grab his screaming toes. He felt a stinging pain as Varuz whacked him across &nbsp;the arse, the sharp smack echoing across the courtyard, and he sprawled onto his &nbsp;face. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c241"><span class="c0">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s pitiful!&rsquo; shouted the old man. &lsquo;You are embarrassing me in front of &nbsp;Major West!&rsquo; The Major had rocked his chair back and was shaking with muffled &nbsp;laughter. Jezal stared at the Marshal&rsquo;s immaculately polished boots, seeing no &nbsp;pressing need to get up. </span></p><p class="c228"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Up, Captain Luthar!&rsquo; shouted Varuz. &lsquo;My time at least is valuable!&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;Alright! Alright!&rsquo; Jezal clambered wearily to his feet and stood there swaying &nbsp;in the hot sun, panting for air, running with sweat. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c305"><span class="c0">Varuz stepped close to him and sniffed at his breath. &lsquo;Have you been drinking &nbsp;today already?&rsquo; he demanded, his grey moustaches bristling. &lsquo;And last night too, &nbsp;no doubt!&rsquo; Jezal had no reply. &lsquo;Well damn you, then! We have work to do, Captain &nbsp;Luthar, and I cannot do it alone! Four months until the Contest, four months to &nbsp;make a master swordsman of you!&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c148"><span class="c0">Varuz waited for a reply, but Jezal could not think of one. He was only really &nbsp;doing this to make his father happy, but somehow he didn&rsquo;t think that was what &nbsp;the old soldier wanted to hear, and he could do without being hit again. &lsquo;Bah!&rsquo; &nbsp;Varuz barked in Jezal&rsquo;s face, and turned away, stick clenched tight behind him in &nbsp;both hands. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c336"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Marshal Var&mdash;&rsquo; Jezal began, but before he could finish the old soldier span &nbsp;around and jabbed him right in the stomach. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c329"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Gargh,&rsquo; said Jezal as he sank to his knees. Varuz stood over him. &nbsp;&lsquo;You are going to go on a little run for me, Captain.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Aaaargh.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c310"><span class="c0">&lsquo;You are going to run from here to the Tower of Chains. You are going to run &nbsp;up the tower to the parapet. We will know when you have arrived, as the Major &nbsp;and I will be enjoying a relaxing game of squares on the roof,&rsquo; he indicated the &nbsp;six-storey building behind him, &lsquo;in plain view of the top of the tower. I will be &nbsp;able to see you with my eye-glass, so there will be no cheating this time!&rsquo; and he &nbsp;whacked Jezal on the top of the head. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Ow,&rsquo; said Jezal, rubbing his scalp. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c321"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Having shown yourself on the roof, you will run back. You will run as fast as &nbsp;you can, and I know this to be true, because if you have not returned by the time &nbsp;we have finished our game, you will go again.&rsquo; Jezal winced. &lsquo;Major West is an &nbsp;excellent hand at squares, so it should take me half an hour to beat him. I suggest &nbsp;you begin at once.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c186"><span class="c0">Jezal lurched to his feet and jogged toward the archway at the far side of the &nbsp;courtyard, muttering curses. </span></p><p class="c324"><span class="c0">&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll need to go faster than that, Captain!&rsquo; Varuz called after him. Jezal&rsquo;s legs &nbsp;were blocks of lead, but he urged them on. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Knees up!&rsquo; shouted Major West cheerily. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c296"><span class="c0">Jezal clattered down the passageway, past a smirking porter sitting by the &nbsp;door, and out onto the broad avenue beyond. He jogged past the ivy-covered &nbsp;walls of the University, cursing the names of Varuz and West under his heaving &nbsp;breath, then by the near windowless mass of the House of Questions, its heavy &nbsp;front gate sealed tight. He passed a few colourless clerks hurrying this way and &nbsp;that, but the Agriont was quiet at this time of the afternoon, and Jezal saw &nbsp;nobody of interest until he passed into the park. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c242"><span class="c0">Three fashionable young ladies were sitting in the shade of a spreading &nbsp;willow by the lake, accompanied by an elderly chaperone. Jezal upped his pace &nbsp;immediately, and replaced his tortured expression with a nonchalant smile. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c269"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Ladies,&rsquo; he said as he flashed past. He heard them giggling to one another &nbsp;behind him and silently congratulated himself, but slowed to half the speed as &nbsp;soon as he was out of sight. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c162"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Varuz be damned,&rsquo; he said to himself, nearly walking as he turned onto the &nbsp;Kingsway, but had to speed up again straight away. Crown Prince Ladisla was not &nbsp;twenty strides off, holding forth to his enormous, brightly coloured retinue. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c280"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Captain Luthar!&rsquo; shouted his Highness, sunlight flashing off his outrageous &nbsp;golden buttons, &lsquo;run for all you&rsquo;re worth! I have a thousand marks on you to win &nbsp;the Contest!&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c237"><span class="c0">Jezal had it on good authority that the Prince had backed Bremer dan Gorst to &nbsp;the tune of two thousand marks, but he still bowed as low as he possibly could &nbsp;while running. The prince&rsquo;s entourage of dandies cheered and shouted half hearted encouragements at his receding back. &lsquo;Bloody idiots,&rsquo; hissed Jezal under &nbsp;his breath, but he would have loved to be one of them. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c206"><span class="c0">He passed the huge stone effigies of six hundred years of High Kings on his &nbsp;right, the statues of their loyal retainers, slightly smaller, on his left. He nodded &nbsp;to the great Magus Bayaz just before he turned into the Square of Marshals, but &nbsp;the wizard frowned back as disapprovingly as ever, the awe-inspiring effect only &nbsp;slightly diminished by a streak of white pigeon shit on his stony cheek. </span></p><p class="c48"><span class="c0">With the Open Council in session the square was almost empty, and Jezal was &nbsp;able to amble over to the gate of the Halls Martial. A thick set sergeant nodded to &nbsp;him as he passed through, and Jezal wondered whether he might be from his &nbsp;own company &ndash; the common soldiers all looked the same, after all. He ignored &nbsp;the man and ran on between the towering white buildings. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c66"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Perfect,&rsquo; muttered Jezal. Jalenhorm and Kaspa were sitting by the door to the &nbsp;Tower of Chains, smoking pipes and laughing. The bastards must have guessed &nbsp;that he&rsquo;d be coming this way. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c133"><span class="c0">&lsquo;For honour, and glory!&rsquo; bellowed Kaspa, rattling his sword in its scabbard as &nbsp;Jezal ran by. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t keep the Lord Marshal waiting!&rsquo; he shouted from behind, and &nbsp;Jezal heard the big man roaring with amusement. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c300"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Bloody idiots,&rsquo; panted Jezal, shouldering open the heavy door, breath rasping &nbsp;as he started up the steep spiral staircase. It was one of the highest towers in the &nbsp;Agriont: there were two hundred and ninety-one steps in all. &lsquo;Bloody steps,&rsquo; he &nbsp;cursed to himself. By the time he reached the hundredth his legs were burning &nbsp;and his chest was heaving. By the time he reached the two-hundredth he was a &nbsp;wreck. He walked the rest of the way, every footfall torture, and eventually burst &nbsp;out through a turret onto the roof and leaned on the parapet, blinking in the &nbsp;sudden brightness. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c42"><span class="c0">To the south the city was spread out below him, an endless carpet of white &nbsp;houses stretching all around the glittering bay. In the other direction, the view &nbsp;over the Agriont was even more impressive. A great confusion of magnificent &nbsp;buildings piled one upon the other, broken up by green lawns and great trees, &nbsp;circled by its wide moat and its towering wall, studded with a hundred lofty &nbsp;towers. The Kingsway sliced straight through the centre toward the Lords&rsquo; &nbsp;Round, its bronze dome shining in the sunlight. The tall spires of the University &nbsp;stood behind, and beyond them loomed the grim immensity of the House of the &nbsp;Maker, rearing high over all like a dark mountain, casting its long shadow across &nbsp;the buildings below. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c263"><span class="c0">Jezal fancied that he saw the sun glint on Marshal Varuz&rsquo; eye-glass in the &nbsp;distance. He cursed once again and made for the stairs. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c145"><span class="c0">Jezal was immensely relieved when he finally made it to the roof and saw that &nbsp;there were still a few white pieces on the board. </span></p><p class="c60"><span class="c0">Marshal Varuz frowned up at him. &lsquo;You are very lucky. The Major has put up &nbsp;an exceptionally determined defence.&rsquo; A smile broke West&rsquo;s features. &lsquo;You must &nbsp;somehow have earned his respect, even if you have yet to win mine.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c333"><span class="c0">Jezal bent over with his hands on his knees, blowing hard and dripping sweat &nbsp;onto the floor. Varuz took the long case from the table, walked over to Jezal and &nbsp;flipped it open. &lsquo;Show us your forms.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c307"><span class="c0">Jezal took the short steel in his left hand and the long in his right. They felt &nbsp;light as feathers after the heavy iron. Marshal Varuz backed away a step. &lsquo;Begin.&rsquo; &nbsp;He snapped into the first form, right arm extended, left close to the body. The &nbsp;blades swished and weaved through the air, glittering in the afternoon sun as &nbsp;Jezal moved from one familiar stance to the next with a practised smoothness. At &nbsp;length he was finished, and he let the steels drop to his sides. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c171"><span class="c0">Varuz nodded. &lsquo;The Captain has fast hands, has he not?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c123"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Truly excellent,&rsquo; said Major West, smiling broadly. &lsquo;A damn sight better than &nbsp;ever I was.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c246"><span class="c0">The Lord Marshal was less impressed. &lsquo;Your knees are too far bent in the &nbsp;third form, and you must strive for more extension on the left arm in the fourth, &nbsp;but otherwise,&rsquo; he paused, &lsquo;passable.&rsquo; Jezal breathed a sigh of relief. That was &nbsp;high praise indeed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c166"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Hah!&rsquo; shouted the old man, striking him in the ribs with the end of the case. &nbsp;Jezal sank to the floor, hardly able to breathe. &lsquo;Your reflexes need work, though, &nbsp;Captain. You should always be ready. Always. If you have steels in your hands, &nbsp;you damn well keep them up.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; croaked Jezal. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c317"><span class="c0">&lsquo;And your stamina is a disgrace, you are blowing like a carp. I have it on good &nbsp;authority that Bremer dan Gorst runs ten miles a day, and barely shows a sweat.&rsquo; &nbsp;Marshal Varuz leaned down over him. &lsquo;From now on you will do the same. Oh &nbsp;yes. A circuit of the wall of the Agriont every morning at six, followed by an hour &nbsp;of sparring with Major West, who has been kind enough to agree to act as your &nbsp;partner. I am confident that he will point up all the little weaknesses in your &nbsp;technique.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c344"><span class="c0">Jezal winced and rubbed his aching ribs. &lsquo;As for the carousing, I want an end &nbsp;to it. I am all for revelry in its proper place, but there will be time for celebration </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">after the Contest, providing you have worked hard enough to win. Until then, &nbsp;clean living is what we need. Do you understand me, Captain Luthar?&rsquo; He leaned &nbsp;down further, pronouncing every word with great care. &lsquo;Clean. Living. Captain.&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;Yes, Marshal Varuz,&rsquo; mumbled Jezal. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c306"><span class="c0">Six hours later he was drunker than shit. Laughing like a lunatic he plunged out &nbsp;into the street, head spinning. The cold air slapped him hard in the face, the mean &nbsp;little buildings weaved and swayed, the ill-lit road tipped like a sinking ship. Jezal &nbsp;wrestled manfully with the urge to vomit, took a swaggering step out into the &nbsp;street, turned to face the door. Smeary bright light and loud sounds of laughter &nbsp;and shouting washed out at him. A ragged shape flew from the tavern and struck &nbsp;him in the chest. Jezal grappled with it desperately, then fell. He hit the ground &nbsp;with a bone-jarring crash. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c248"><span class="c0">The world was dark for a moment, then he found himself squashed into the &nbsp;dirt with Kaspa on top of him. &lsquo;Damn it!&rsquo; he gurgled, tongue thick and clumsy in &nbsp;his mouth. He shoved the giggling Lieutenant away with his elbow, rolled over &nbsp;and lurched up, stumbling about as the street see-sawed around him. Kaspa lay &nbsp;on his back in the dirt, choking with laughter, reeking of cheap booze and sour &nbsp;smoke. Jezal made a lame attempt to brush the dirt from his uniform. There was &nbsp;a big wet patch on his chest that smelled of beer. &lsquo;Damn it!&rsquo; he mumbled again. &nbsp;When had that happened? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c61"><span class="c0">He became aware of some shouting on the other side of the road. Two men &nbsp;grappling in a doorway. Jezal squinted hard, strained against the gloom. A big &nbsp;man had hold of some well-dressed fellow, and seemed to be tying his hands &nbsp;behind his back. Now he was forcing some kind of bag over his head. Jezal &nbsp;blinked in disbelief. It was far from a reputable area, but this seemed somewhat &nbsp;strong. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c205"><span class="c0">The door of the tavern banged open and West and Jalenhorm came out, deep &nbsp;in drunken conversation, something about someone&rsquo;s sister. Bright light cut &nbsp;across the street and illuminated the two struggling men starkly. The big one was &nbsp;dressed all in black, with a mask over the lower part of his face. He had white &nbsp;hair, white eyebrows, skin white as milk. Jezal stared at the white devil across &nbsp;the road, and he glared back with narrowed pink eyes. </span></p><p class="c303"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Help!&rsquo; It was the fellow with the bag on his head, his voice shrill with fear. &nbsp;&lsquo;Help, I am&mdash;&rsquo; The white man dealt him a savage blow in the midriff and he folded &nbsp;up with a sigh. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;You there!&rsquo; shouted West. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c183"><span class="c0">Jalenhorm was already rushing across the street. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&lsquo;What?&rsquo; said Kaspa, propped up on his elbows in the road. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c337"><span class="c0">Jezal&rsquo;s mind was full of mud, but his feet seemed to be following Jalenhorm, &nbsp;so he stumbled along with them, feeling very sick. West came behind him. The &nbsp;white ghost started up and turned to stand between them and his prisoner. &nbsp;Another man moved briskly out of the shadows, tall and thin, dressed all in black &nbsp;and masked, but with long greasy hair. He held up a gloved hand. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; his whining commoner&rsquo;s voice was muffled by his mask, &nbsp;&lsquo;gentlemen please, we&rsquo;re on the King&rsquo;s business!&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c327"><span class="c0">&lsquo;The King conducts his business in the day-time,&rsquo; growled Jalenhorm. &nbsp;The new arrival&rsquo;s mask twitched slightly as he smiled. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s why he needs &nbsp;us for the night-time stuff, eh, friend?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c243"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Who is this man?&rsquo; West was pointing at the fellow with the bag on his head. &nbsp;The prisoner was struggling up again. &lsquo;I am Sepp dan &ndash; oof!&rsquo; The white &nbsp;monster silenced him with a heavy fist in the face, knocking him limp into the &nbsp;road. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c0">Jalenhorm put a hand on the hilt of his sword, jaw clenching, and the white &nbsp;ghost loomed forward with a terrible speed. Close up he was even more massive, &nbsp;alien, and terrifying. Jalenhorm took an involuntary step back, stumbled on the &nbsp;rutted surface of the road and pitched onto his back with a crash. Jezal&rsquo;s head &nbsp;was thumping. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c91"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Back!&rsquo; bellowed West. His sword whipped out of its scabbard with a faint &nbsp;ringing. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c335"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Thaaaaah!&rsquo; hissed the monster, fists clenched like two big white rocks. &nbsp;&lsquo;Aargh,&rsquo; gurgled the man with the bag on his head. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c159"><span class="c0">Jezal&rsquo;s heart was in his mouth. He looked at the thin man. The thin man&rsquo;s eyes &nbsp;smiled back. How could anyone smile at a time like this? Jezal was surprised to &nbsp;see that he had a long, ugly knife in his hand. Where did that come from? He &nbsp;fumbled drunkenly for his sword. </span></p><p class="c255"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Major West!&rsquo; came a voice from the shadows down the street. Jezal paused, &nbsp;uncertain, steel halfway out. Jalenhorm scrambled to his feet, the back of his &nbsp;uniform crusted with mud, pulled out his own sword. The pale monster stared at &nbsp;them unblinking, not retreating a finger&rsquo;s breadth. </span></p><p class="c173"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Major West!&rsquo; came the voice again, accompanied now by a clicking, scraping &nbsp;sound. West&rsquo;s face had turned pale. A figure emerged from the shadows, limping &nbsp;badly, cane tapping on the dirt. His broad-brimmed hat obscured the upper part &nbsp;of his face, but his mouth was twisted into a strange smile. Jezal noticed with a &nbsp;sudden wave of nausea that his four front teeth were missing. He shuffled &nbsp;towards them, ignoring all the naked steel, and offered his free hand to West. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c253"><span class="c0">The Major slowly sheathed his sword, took the hand and shook it limply. &nbsp;&lsquo;Colonel Glokta?&rsquo; he asked in a husky voice. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c320"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Your humble servant, though I&rsquo;m no longer an army man. I&rsquo;m with the King&rsquo;s &nbsp;Inquisition now.&rsquo; He reached up slowly and removed his hat. His face was deathly &nbsp;pale, deeply lined, close-cropped hair scattered with grey. His eyes stared out &nbsp;feverish bright from deep, dark rings, the left one noticeably narrower than the &nbsp;right, pink-rimmed and glistening wet. &lsquo;And these are my assistants, Practicals &nbsp;Severard,&rsquo; the lanky one gave a mockery of a bow, &lsquo;and Frost.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c72"><span class="c0">The white monster jerked the prisoner to his feet with one hand. &lsquo;Hold on,&rsquo; &nbsp;said Jalenhorm, stepping forward, but the Inquisitor put a gentle hand on his &nbsp;arm. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c180"><span class="c0">&lsquo;This man is a prisoner of His Majesty&rsquo;s Inquisition, Lieutenant Jalenhorm.&rsquo; &nbsp;The big man paused, surprised to be called by name. &lsquo;I realise your motives are of &nbsp;the best, but he is a criminal, a traitor. I have a warrant for him, signed by Arch &nbsp;Lector Sult himself. He is most unworthy of your assistance, believe me.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c293"><span class="c0">Jalenhorm frowned and stared balefully at Practical Frost. The pale devil &nbsp;looked terrified. About as terrified as a stone. He hauled the prisoner over his &nbsp;shoulder without apparent effort and turned up the street. The one called &nbsp;Severard smiled with his eyes, sheathed his knife, bowed again and followed his &nbsp;companion, whistling tunelessly as he sauntered off. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">The Inquisitor&rsquo;s left eyelid began to flutter and tears rolled down his pale &nbsp;cheek. He wiped it carefully on the back of his hand. &lsquo;Please forgive me. Honestly. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s coming to something when a man can&rsquo;t control his own eyes, eh? Damn </span></p><p class="c181"><span class="c0">weeping jelly. Sometimes I think I should just have it out, and make do with a &nbsp;patch.&rsquo; Jezal&rsquo;s stomach roiled. &lsquo;How long has it been, West? Seven years? Eight?&rsquo; &nbsp;A muscle was working on the side of the Major&rsquo;s head. &lsquo;Nine.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c112"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Imagine that. Nine years. Can you believe it? It seems like only yesterday. It &nbsp;was on the ridge, wasn&rsquo;t it, where we parted?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c75"><span class="c0">&lsquo;On the ridge, yes.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c178"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, West, I don&rsquo;t blame you in the least.&rsquo; Glokta slapped the Major &nbsp;warmly on the arm. &lsquo;Not for that, anyway. You tried to talk me out of it, I &nbsp;remember. I had time enough to think about it in Gurkhul, after all. Lots of time &nbsp;to think. You were always a good friend to me. And now young Collem West, a &nbsp;Major in the King&rsquo;s Own, imagine that.&rsquo; Jezal had not the slightest idea what they &nbsp;were talking about. He wanted only to be sick, then go to bed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c308"><span class="c0">Inquisitor Glokta turned toward him with a smile, displaying once again the &nbsp;hideous gap in his teeth. &lsquo;And this must be Captain Luthar, for whom everyone &nbsp;has such high hopes in the coming Contest. Marshal Varuz is a hard master, is he &nbsp;not?&rsquo; He waved his cane weakly at Jezal. &lsquo;Jab, jab, eh, Captain? Jab, jab.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c188"><span class="c0">Jezal felt his bile rising. He coughed and looked down at his feet, willing the &nbsp;world to remain motionless. The Inquisitor looked around expectantly at each of &nbsp;them in turn. West looked pale. Jalenhorm mud-stained and sulky. Kaspa was &nbsp;still sitting in the road. None of them had anything to say. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c138"><span class="c0">Glokta cleared his throat. &lsquo;Well, duty calls,&rsquo; he bowed stiffly, &lsquo;but I hope to see &nbsp;you all again. Very soon.&rsquo; Jezal found himself hoping he never saw the man again. &nbsp;&lsquo;Perhaps we might fence again sometime?&rsquo; muttered Major West. &nbsp;Glokta gave a good natured laugh. &lsquo;Oh, I would enjoy that, West, but I find that &nbsp;I&rsquo;m ever so slightly crippled these days. If you&rsquo;re after a fight, I&rsquo;m sure that &nbsp;Practical Frost could oblige you,&rsquo; he looked over at Jalenhorm, &lsquo;but I must warn &nbsp;you, he doesn&rsquo;t fight like a gentleman. I wish you all a pleasant evening.&rsquo; He &nbsp;placed his hat back on his head then turned slowly and shuffled off down the &nbsp;dingy street. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c0">The three officers watched him limp away in an interminable, awkward &nbsp;silence. Kaspa finally stumbled over. &lsquo;What was all that about?&rsquo; he asked. &nbsp;&lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; said West through gritted teeth. &lsquo;Best we forget it ever happened.&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c50"><span class="c1">Teeth and Fingers </span></p><p class="c212"><span class="c0">Time is short. We must work quickly. Glokta nodded to Severard, and he smiled &nbsp;and pulled the bag off Sepp dan Teufel&rsquo;s head. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">The Master of the Mints was a strong, noble-looking man. His face was &nbsp;already starting to bruise. &lsquo;What is the meaning of this?&rsquo; he roared, all bluster and &nbsp;bravado. &lsquo;Do you know who I am?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">Glokta snorted. &lsquo;Of course we know who you are. Do you think we are in the &nbsp;habit of snatching people from the streets at random?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c152"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I am the Master of the Royal Mints!&rsquo; yelled the prisoner, struggling at his &nbsp;bonds. Practical Frost looked on impassively, arms folded. The irons were &nbsp;already glowing orange in the brazier. &lsquo;How dare you . . .&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c276"><span class="c0">&lsquo;We cannot have these constant interruptions!&rsquo; shouted Glokta. Frost kicked &nbsp;Teufel savagely in the shin and he yelped with pain. &lsquo;How can our prisoner sign &nbsp;his paper of confession if his hands are tied? Please release him.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c274"><span class="c0">Teufel stared suspiciously around as the albino untied his wrists. Then he &nbsp;saw the cleaver. The polished blade shone mirror bright in the harsh lamp &nbsp;light. Truly a thing of beauty. You&rsquo;d like to have that, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Teufel? I bet &nbsp;you&rsquo;d like to cut my head off with it. Glokta almost hoped that he would, his right &nbsp;hand seemed to be reaching for it, but he used it to shove the paper of confession &nbsp;away instead. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c332"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Glokta, &lsquo;the Master of the Mints is a right-handed gentleman.&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;A right-handed gentleman,&rsquo; Severard hissed in the prisoner&rsquo;s ear. &nbsp;Teufel was staring across the table through narrowed eyes. &lsquo;I know you! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c51"><span class="c0">Glokta, isn&rsquo;t it? The one who was captured in Gurkhul, the one they tortured. &nbsp;Sand dan Glokta, am I right? Well, you&rsquo;re in over your head this time, I can tell &nbsp;you! Right in over your head! When High Justice Marovia hears about this . . .&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c251"><span class="c0">Glokta sprang to his feet, his chair screeching on the tiles. His left leg was &nbsp;agony, but he ignored it. &lsquo;Look at this!&rsquo; he hissed, then opened his mouth wide, &nbsp;giving the horrified prisoner a good look at his teeth. Or what&rsquo;s left of them. &lsquo;You &nbsp;see that? You see? Where they cracked out the teeth above, they left them below, </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">and where they took them out below, they left them above, all the way to the &nbsp;back. See?&rsquo; Glokta pulled his cheeks back with his fingers so Teufel could get a &nbsp;better view. &lsquo;They did it with a tiny chisel. A little bit each day. It took months.&rsquo; &nbsp;Glokta sat down stiffly, then smiled wide. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c0">&lsquo;What excellent work, eh? The irony of it! To leave you half your teeth, but not &nbsp;a one of &rsquo;em any use! I have soup most days.&rsquo; The Master of the Mints swallowed &nbsp;hard. Glokta could see a drop of sweat running down his neck. &lsquo;And the teeth &nbsp;were just the beginning. I have to piss sitting down like a woman, you know. I&rsquo;m &nbsp;thirty-five years old, and I need help getting out of bed.&rsquo; He leaned back again and &nbsp;stretched out his leg with a wince. &lsquo;Every day is its own little hell for me. Every &nbsp;day. So tell me, can you seriously believe that anything you might say could scare &nbsp;me?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c224"><span class="c0">Glokta studied his prisoner, taking his time. No longer half so sure of &nbsp;himself. &lsquo;Confess,&rsquo; he whispered. &lsquo;Then we can ship you off to Angland and still &nbsp;get some sleep tonight.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c124"><span class="c0">Teufel&rsquo;s face had turned almost as pale as Practical Frost&rsquo;s, but he said &nbsp;nothing. The Arch Lector will be here soon. Already on his way, most likely. If there &nbsp;is no confession when he arrives . . . we&rsquo;ll all be off to Angland. At best. Glokta took &nbsp;hold of his cane and got to his feet. &lsquo;I like to think of myself as an artist, but &nbsp;artistry takes time and we have wasted half the evening searching for you in &nbsp;every brothel in the city. Thankfully, Practical Frost has a keen nose and an &nbsp;excellent sense of direction. He can sniff out a rat in a shithouse.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c56"><span class="c0">&lsquo;A rat in a shithouse,&rsquo; echoed Severard, eyes glittering bright in the orange &nbsp;glow from the brazier. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c165"><span class="c0">&lsquo;We are on a tight schedule so let me be blunt. You will confess to me within &nbsp;ten minutes.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c157"><span class="c0">Teufel snorted and folded his arms. &lsquo;Never.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c271"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Hold him.&rsquo; Frost seized the prisoner from behind and folded him in a vice like grip, pinning his right arm to his side. Severard grabbed hold of his left wrist &nbsp;and spread his fingers out on the scarred table-top. Glokta curled his fist round &nbsp;the smooth grip of the cleaver, the blade scraping against the wood as he pulled &nbsp;it slowly towards him. He stared down at Teufel&rsquo;s hand. What beautiful </span></p><p class="c185"><span class="c0">fingernails he has. How long and glossy. You cannot work down a mine with nails &nbsp;like that. Glokta raised the cleaver high. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Wait!&rsquo; screamed the prisoner. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c284"><span class="c0">Bang! The heavy blade bit deep into the table top, neatly paring off Teufel&rsquo;s &nbsp;middle fingernail. He was breathing fast now, and there was a sheen of sweat on &nbsp;his forehead. Now we&rsquo;ll see what kind of a man you really are. </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I think you can see where this is going,&rsquo; said Glokta. &lsquo;You know, they did it to &nbsp;a corporal who was captured with me, one cut a day. He was a tough man, very &nbsp;tough. They made it past his elbow before he died.&rsquo; Glokta lifted the cleaver &nbsp;again. &lsquo;Confess.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t . . .&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c151"><span class="c0">Bang! The cleaver took off the very tip of Teufel&rsquo;s middle finger. Blood &nbsp;bubbled out on to the table top. Severard&rsquo;s eyes were smiling in the lamp light. &nbsp;Teufel&rsquo;s jaw dropped. But the pain will be a while coming. &lsquo;Confess!&rsquo; bellowed &nbsp;Glokta. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c99"><span class="c0">Bang! The cleaver took off the top of Teufel&rsquo;s ring finger, and a little disc out &nbsp;of his middle finger which rolled a short way and dropped off onto the floor. &nbsp;Frost&rsquo;s face was carved from marble. &lsquo;Confess!&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c252"><span class="c0">Bang! The tip of Teufel&rsquo;s index finger jumped in the air. His middle finger was &nbsp;down to the first joint. Glokta paused, wiping the sweat from his forehead on the &nbsp;back of his hand. His leg was throbbing with the exertion. Blood was dripping &nbsp;onto the tiles with a steady tap, tap, tap. Teufel was staring wide-eyed at his &nbsp;shortened fingers. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c118"><span class="c0">Severard shook his head. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s excellent work, Inquisitor.&rsquo; He flicked one of &nbsp;the discs of flesh across the table. &lsquo;The precision . . . I&rsquo;m in awe.&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;Aaaargh!&rsquo; screamed the Master of the Mints. Now it dawns on him. Glokta &nbsp;raised the cleaver once again. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c75"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I will confess!&rsquo; shrieked Teufel, &lsquo;I will confess!&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Excellent,&rsquo; said Glokta brightly. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Excellent,&rsquo; said Severard. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Etherer,&rsquo; said Practical Frost. </span></p><p class="c50"><span class="c1">The Wide and Barren North </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">The Magi are an ancient and mysterious order, learned in the secrets of the &nbsp;world, practised in the ways of magic, wise and powerful beyond the dreams of &nbsp;men. That was the rumour. Such a one should have ways of finding a man, even a &nbsp;man alone in the wide and barren North. If that was so, then he was taking his &nbsp;time about it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c238"><span class="c0">Logen scratched at his tangled beard and wondered what was keeping the &nbsp;great one. Perhaps he was lost. He asked himself again if he should have stayed &nbsp;in the forests, where food at least was plentiful. But to the south the spirits had &nbsp;said, and if you went south from the hills you came to these withered moors. So &nbsp;here he had waited in the briars and the mud, in bad weather, and mostly gone &nbsp;hungry. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c0">His boots were worn out anyway, so he had set his miserable camp not far &nbsp;from the road, the better to see this wizard coming. Since the wars, the North &nbsp;was full of dangerous scum &ndash; deserting warriors turned bandit, peasants fled &nbsp;from their burned-out land, leaderless and desperate men with nothing left to &nbsp;lose, and so on. Logen wasn&rsquo;t worried, though. No one had a reason to come to &nbsp;this arsehole of the world. No one but him and the Magus. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">So he sat and waited, looked for food, didn&rsquo;t find any, sat and waited some &nbsp;more. At this time of year the moors were often soaked by sudden downpours, &nbsp;but he would have smoky, thorny little fires by night if he could, to keep his &nbsp;flagging spirits up and attract any passing wizards. It had been raining this &nbsp;evening, but it had stopped a while before and it was dry enough for a fire. Now &nbsp;he had his pot over it, cooking a stew with the last of the meat he had brought &nbsp;with him from the forest. He would have to move on in the morning, and look for &nbsp;food. The Magus could catch up with him later, if he still cared. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c127"><span class="c0">He was stirring his meagre meal, and wondering whether to go back north or &nbsp;move on south tomorrow, when he heard the sound of hooves on the road. One &nbsp;horse, moving slowly. He sat back on his coat and waited. There was a neigh, the &nbsp;jingle of a harness. A rider came over the rise. With the watery sun low on the </span></p><p class="c121"><span class="c0">horizon behind, Logen couldn&rsquo;t see him clearly, but he sat stiff and awkward in &nbsp;his saddle, like a man not used to the road. He urged his horse gently in the &nbsp;direction of the fire and reined in a few yards away. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Good evening,&rsquo; he said. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c179"><span class="c0">He was not in the least what Logen had been expecting. A gaunt, pale, sickly looking young man with dark rings round his eyes, long hair plastered to his &nbsp;head by the drizzle and a nervous smile. He seemed more wet than wise, and &nbsp;certainly didn&rsquo;t look powerful beyond the dreams of men. He looked mostly &nbsp;hungry, cold, and ill. He looked something like Logen felt, in fact. &nbsp;&lsquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you have a staff?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c71"><span class="c0">The young man looked surprised. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t . . . that is to say . . . er . . . I&rsquo;m not a &nbsp;Magus.&rsquo; He trailed off and licked his lips nervously. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c282"><span class="c0">&lsquo;The spirits told me to expect a Magus, but they&rsquo;re often wrong.&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;Oh . . . well, I&rsquo;m an apprentice. But my Master, the great Bayaz,&rsquo; and he bowed &nbsp;his head reverently, &lsquo;is none other than the First of the Magi, great in High Art &nbsp;and learned in deep wisdom. He sent me to find you,&rsquo; he looked suddenly &nbsp;doubtful, &lsquo;and bring you . . . you are Logen Ninefingers?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c343"><span class="c0">Logen held up his left hand and looked at the pale young man through the gap &nbsp;where his middle finger used to be. &lsquo;Oh good.&rsquo; The apprentice breathed a sigh of &nbsp;relief, then suddenly stopped himself. &lsquo;Oh, that is to say . . . er . . . sorry about the &nbsp;finger.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c115"><span class="c0">Logen laughed. It was the first time since he dragged himself out of the river. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t very funny but he laughed loud. It felt good. The young man smiled and &nbsp;slipped painfully from the saddle. &lsquo;I am Malacus Quai.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Malacus what?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c116"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Quai,&rsquo; he said, making for the fire. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&lsquo;What kind of a name is that?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I am from the Old Empire.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c68"><span class="c0">Logen had never heard of any such place. &lsquo;An empire, eh?&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, it was, once. &nbsp;The mightiest nation in the Circle of the World.&rsquo; The young man squatted down &nbsp;stiffly by the fire. &lsquo;But the glory of the past is long faded. It&rsquo;s not much more than &nbsp;a huge battlefield now.&rsquo; Logen nodded. He knew well enough what one of those </span></p><p class="c149"><span class="c0">looked like. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s far away. In the west of the world.&rsquo; The apprentice waved his &nbsp;hand vaguely. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c106"><span class="c0">Logen laughed again. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s east.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c114"><span class="c0">Quai smiled sadly. &lsquo;I am a seer, though not, it seems, a very good one. Master &nbsp;Bayaz sent me to find you, but the stars have not been auspicious and I became &nbsp;lost in the bad weather.&rsquo; He pushed his hair out of his eyes and spread his hands. &nbsp;&lsquo;I had a packhorse, with food and supplies, and another horse for you, but I lost &nbsp;them in a storm. I fear I am no outdoorsman.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Seems not.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Quai took a flask from his pocket and leaned across with it. Logen took it from &nbsp;him, opened it, took a swig. The hot liquor ran down his throat, warmed him to &nbsp;the roots of his hair. &lsquo;Well, Malacus Quai, you lost your food but you kept hold of &nbsp;what really mattered. It takes an effort to make me smile these days. You&rsquo;re right &nbsp;welcome at my fire.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c119"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Thank you.&rsquo; The apprentice paused and held his palms out to the meagre &nbsp;flames. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t eaten for two days.&rsquo; He shook his head, hair flapping back and &nbsp;forth. &lsquo;It has been . . . a difficult time.&rsquo; He licked his lips and looked at the pot. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Logen passed him the spoon. Malacus Quai stared at it with big round eyes. &nbsp;&lsquo;Have you eaten?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c0">Logen nodded. He hadn&rsquo;t, but the wretched apprentice looked famished and &nbsp;there was barely enough for one. He took another swig from the flask. That &nbsp;would do for him, for now. Quai attacked the stew with relish. When it was done &nbsp;he scraped the pot out, licked the spoon, then licked the edge of the pot for good &nbsp;measure. He sat back against a big rock. &lsquo;I am forever in your debt, Logen &nbsp;Ninefingers, you&rsquo;ve saved my life. I hardly dared hope you&rsquo;d be so gracious a &nbsp;host.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c154"><span class="c0">&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not quite what I expected either, being honest.&rsquo; Logen pulled at the &nbsp;flask again, and licked his lips. &lsquo;Who is this Bayaz?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c204"><span class="c0">&lsquo;The First of the Magi, great in High Art and learned in deep wisdom. I fear he &nbsp;will be most seriously displeased with me.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;He&rsquo;s to be feared, then?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c116"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied the apprentice weakly, &lsquo;he does have a bit of a temper.&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c107"><span class="c0">Logen took another swallow. The warmth was spreading through his body &nbsp;now, the first time he had felt warm in weeks. There was a pause. &lsquo;What does he &nbsp;want from me, Quai?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c326"><span class="c0">There was no reply. The soft sound of snoring came from across the fire. &nbsp;Logen smiled and, wrapping himself in his coat, lay down to sleep as well. &nbsp;The apprentice woke with a sudden fit of coughing. It was early morning and the &nbsp;dingy world was thick with mist. It was probably better that way. There was &nbsp;nothing to see but miles of mud, rock, and miserable brown gorse. Everything &nbsp;was coated in cold dew, but Logen had managed to get a sad tongue of fire going. &nbsp;Quai&rsquo;s hair was plastered to his pallid face. He rolled onto his side and coughed &nbsp;phlegm onto the ground. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Aaargh,&rsquo; he croaked. He coughed and spat again. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c83"><span class="c0">Logen secured the last of his meagre gear on the unhappy horse. &lsquo;Morning,&rsquo; &nbsp;he said, looking up at the white sky, &lsquo;though not a good one.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I will die. I will die, and then I will not have to move.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c143"><span class="c0">&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got no food, so if we stay here you will die. Then I can eat you and go &nbsp;back over the mountains.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c174"><span class="c0">The apprentice smiled weakly. &lsquo;What do we do?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c183"><span class="c0">What indeed? &lsquo;Where do we find this Bayaz?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&lsquo;At the Great Northern Library.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c170"><span class="c0">Logen had never heard of it, but then he&rsquo;d never been that interested in &nbsp;books. &lsquo;Which is where?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s south of here, about four days&rsquo; ride, beside a great lake.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Do you know the way?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c260"><span class="c0">The apprentice tottered to his feet and stood, swaying slightly, breathing fast &nbsp;and shallow. He was ghostly pale and his face had a sheen of sweat. &lsquo;I think so,&rsquo; &nbsp;he muttered, but he hardly looked certain. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c225"><span class="c0">Neither Quai nor his horse would make four days without food, even &nbsp;providing they didn&rsquo;t get lost. Food had to be the first thing. To follow the road &nbsp;through the woods to the south was the best option, despite the greater risk. &nbsp;They might get killed by bandits, but the forage would be better, and the hunger &nbsp;would likely kill them otherwise. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better ride,&rsquo; said Logen. </span></p><p class="c208"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I lost the horses, I should be the one to walk.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c235"><span class="c0">Logen put his hand on Quai&rsquo;s forehead. It was hot and clammy. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve a &nbsp;fever. You&rsquo;d better ride.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c55"><span class="c0">The apprentice didn&rsquo;t try to argue. He looked down at Logen&rsquo;s ragged boots. &nbsp;&lsquo;Can you take my boots?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c129"><span class="c0">Logen shook his head. &lsquo;Too small.&rsquo; He knelt down over the smouldering &nbsp;remains of the fire and pursed his lips. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c316"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Fires have spirits. I will keep this one under my tongue, and we can use it to &nbsp;light another fire later.&rsquo; Quai looked too ill to be surprised. Logen sucked up the &nbsp;spirit, coughed on the smoke, shuddered at the bitter taste. &lsquo;You ready to leave?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c67"><span class="c0">The apprentice raised his arms in a hopeless gesture. &lsquo;I am packed.&rsquo; &nbsp;Malacus Quai loved to talk. He talked as they made their way south across the &nbsp;moors, as the sun climbed into the grimy skies, as they entered the woods &nbsp;toward evening time. His illness did nothing to stop his chatter, but Logen didn&rsquo;t &nbsp;mind. It was a long time since anyone had talked to him, and it helped to take his &nbsp;mind off his feet. He was starving and tired, but it was his feet that were the &nbsp;problem. His boots were tatters of old leather, his toes cut and battered, his calf &nbsp;was still burning from the Shanka&rsquo;s teeth. Every step was an ordeal. Once they &nbsp;had called him the most feared man in the North. Now he was afraid of the &nbsp;smallest sticks and stones in the road. There was a joke in there somewhere. He &nbsp;winced as his foot hit a pebble. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c45"><span class="c0">&lsquo;. . . so I spent seven years studying with Master Zacharus. He is great among &nbsp;the Magi, the fifth of Juvens&rsquo; twelve apprentices, a great man.&rsquo; Everything &nbsp;connected with the Magi seemed to be great in Quai&rsquo;s eyes. &lsquo;He felt I was ready to &nbsp;come to the Great Northern Library and study with Master Bayaz, to earn my &nbsp;staff. But things have not been easy for me here. Master Bayaz is most &nbsp;demanding and . . .&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c0">The horse stopped and snorted, shied and took a hesitant step back. Logen &nbsp;sniffed the air and frowned. There were men nearby, and badly washed ones. He &nbsp;should have noticed it sooner but his attention had been on his feet. Quai looked &nbsp;down at him. &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c52"><span class="c0">As if in answer a man stepped out from behind a tree perhaps ten strides &nbsp;ahead, another a little further down the road. They were scum, without a doubt. &nbsp;Dirty, bearded, dressed in ragged bits of mismatched fur and leather. Not, on the &nbsp;whole, unlike Logen. The skinny one on the left had a spear with a barbed head. &nbsp;The big one on the right had a heavy sword speckled with rust, and an old dented &nbsp;helmet with a spike on top. They moved forward, grinning. There was a sound &nbsp;behind and Logen looked over his shoulder, his heart sinking. A third man, with a &nbsp;big boil on his face, was making his way cautiously down the road toward them, a &nbsp;heavy wood axe in his hands. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c104"><span class="c0">Quai leaned down from his saddle, eyes wide with fear. &lsquo;Are they bandits?&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re the fucking seer,&rsquo; hissed Logen through gritted teeth. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c244"><span class="c0">They stopped a stride or two in front. The one with the helmet seemed to be &nbsp;in charge. &lsquo;Nice horse,&rsquo; he growled. &lsquo;Would you lend it to us?&rsquo; The one with the &nbsp;spear grinned as he took hold of the bridle. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c298"><span class="c0">Things had taken a turn for the worse alright. A moment ago that had hardly &nbsp;seemed possible, but fate had found a way. Logen doubted that Quai would be &nbsp;much use in a fight. That left him alone against three or more, and with only a &nbsp;knife. If he did nothing him and Malacus would end up robbed, and more than &nbsp;likely killed. You have to be realistic about these things. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c302"><span class="c0">He looked the three bandits over again. They didn&rsquo;t expect a fight, not from &nbsp;two unarmed men &ndash; the spear was sideways on, the sword pointed at the ground. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t know about the axe, so he&rsquo;d have to trust to luck with that one. It&rsquo;s a &nbsp;sorry fact that the man who strikes first usually strikes last, so Logen turned to &nbsp;the one with the helmet and spat the spirit in his face. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c195"><span class="c0">It ignited in the air and pounced on him hungrily. His head burst into spitting &nbsp;flames, the sword clattered to the ground. He clawed desperately at his face and &nbsp;his arms caught fire as well. He reeled screaming away. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c182"><span class="c0">Quai&rsquo;s horse startled at the flames and reared up, snorting. The skinny man &nbsp;stumbled back with a gasp and Logen leaped at him, grabbed the shaft of the &nbsp;spear with one hand and butted him in the face. His nose crunched against &nbsp;Logen&rsquo;s forehead and he staggered away with blood streaming down his chin. &nbsp;Logen jerked him back with the spear, swung his right arm round in a wide arc </span></p><p class="c315"><span class="c0">and punched him in the neck. He went down with a gurgle and Logen tore the &nbsp;spear from his hands. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c0">He felt movement behind him and dropped to the ground, rolling away to his &nbsp;left. The axe whistled through the air above his head and cut a long slash in the &nbsp;horse&rsquo;s side, spattering drops of blood across the ground and ripping the buckle &nbsp;on the saddle girth open. Boil-face tottered away, spinning around after his axe. &nbsp;Logen sprang at him but his ankle twisted on a stone and he tottered like a &nbsp;drunkard, yelping at the pain. An arrow hummed past his face from somewhere &nbsp;in the trees behind and was lost in the bushes on the other side of the road. The &nbsp;horse snorted and kicked, eyes rolling madly, then took off down the road at a &nbsp;crazy gallop. Malacus Quai wailed as the saddle slid off its back and he was flung &nbsp;into the bushes. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c259"><span class="c0">There was no time to think about him. Logen charged at the axe-man with a &nbsp;roar, aiming the spear at his heart. He brought his axe up in time to nudge the &nbsp;point away, but not far enough. The spear spitted him through the shoulder, spun &nbsp;him round. There was a sharp crack as the shaft snapped, Logen lost his balance &nbsp;and pitched forward, bearing Boil-face down into the road. The spear-point &nbsp;sticking out of his back cut a deep gash into Logen&rsquo;s scalp as he fell on top of him. &nbsp;Logen seized hold of the axe-man&rsquo;s matted hair with both hands, pulled his head &nbsp;back and mashed his face into a rock. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c135"><span class="c0">He lurched to his feet, head spinning, wiping blood out of his eyes just in time &nbsp;to see an arrow zip out of the trees and thud into a trunk a stride or two away. &nbsp;Logen hurtled at the archer. He saw him now, a boy no more than fourteen, &nbsp;reaching for another arrow. Logen pulled out his knife. The boy was nocking the &nbsp;arrow to his bow, but his eyes were wide with panic. He fumbled the string and &nbsp;drove the arrow through his hand, looking greatly surprised. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c294"><span class="c0">Logen was on him. The boy swung the bow at him but he ducked below it and &nbsp;jumped forward, driving the knife up with both hands. The blade caught the boy &nbsp;under the chin and lifted him into the air, then snapped off in his neck. He &nbsp;dropped on top of Logen, the jagged shard of the knife cutting a long gash in his &nbsp;arm. Blood splattered everywhere, from the cut on Logen&rsquo;s head, from the cut on &nbsp;Logen&rsquo;s arm, from the gaping wound in the boy&rsquo;s throat. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">He shoved the corpse away, staggered against a tree and gasped for breath. &nbsp;His heart was pounding, the blood roaring in his ears, his stomach turning over. &lsquo;I &nbsp;am still alive,&rsquo; he whispered, &lsquo;I am still alive.&rsquo; The cuts on his head and his arm &nbsp;were starting to throb. Two more scars. It could have been a lot worse. He &nbsp;scraped the blood from his eyes and limped back to the road. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c220"><span class="c0">Malacus Quai was standing, staring ashen-faced at the three corpses. Logen &nbsp;took him by the shoulders, looked him up and down. &lsquo;You hurt?&rsquo; &nbsp;Quai only stared at the bodies. &lsquo;Are they dead?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c76"><span class="c0">The corpse of the big one with the helmet was still smoking, making a &nbsp;disgustingly appetising smell. He had a good pair of boots on, Logen noticed, a lot &nbsp;better than his own. The one with the boil had his neck turned too far around to &nbsp;be alive, that and he had the broken spear through him. Logen rolled the skinny &nbsp;one over with his foot. He still had a look of surprise on his bloody face, eyes &nbsp;staring up at the sky, mouth open. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c95"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Must&rsquo;ve crushed his windpipe,&rsquo; muttered Logen. His hands were covered in &nbsp;blood. He grabbed one with the other to stop them from trembling. &nbsp;&lsquo;What about the one in the trees?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c106"><span class="c0">Logen nodded. &lsquo;What happened to the horse?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c116"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Gone,&rsquo; muttered Quai hopelessly. &lsquo;What do we do?&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c203"><span class="c0">&lsquo;We see if they&rsquo;ve got any food.&rsquo; Logen pointed to the smoking corpse. &lsquo;And &nbsp;you help me get his boots off.&rsquo; </span></p></body></html>
